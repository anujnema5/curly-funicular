Va **(Bm)** cation **(G)** home in Flo **(D)** rida\

You wonder **(Bm)**\
**(D)** If you can **(G)** even be seen **(D)**\
From **(Bm)** so far **(D)** away **(G)**\
**(D)** A slow **(Bm)** pull\
**(D)** A seismic **(Bm)** drift\
**(D)** Leaning over **(Bm)** the edge **(D)** of the **(G)** continent\
**(D)** It's so hard **(Bm)** to come **(G)** back\
**(D)** You hang on\
**(G)** Until it drags\

**(D)** You under, **(Bm)** you under
