**(F)** **(C)** **(G)**

### Verse 1: We The Kings

**(C)** You and **(G)** I\
We're like **(Am)** fireworks and symphonies **(F)** exploding in the sky\
With **(C)** you, I'm **(G)** alive\
Like all the **(Am)** missing pieces of my heart, they **(F)** finally collide

### Pre-Chorus: We The Kings

So **(F)** stop time right here in the **(G)** moonlight\
'Cause I don't **(Am)** ever wanna close my **(Bb)** eyes

### Chorus: We The Kings

Without **(F)** you, I feel **(C)** broke\
Like **(G)** I'm half of a whole\
Without **(F)** you, I've **(C)** got no hand to **(G)** hold\
Without **(F)** you, I feel **(C)** torn\
Like a **(G)** sail **(Am)** in a **(G)** **(F)** storm\
Without **(G)** you, I'm just a **(F)** sad **(C)** song **(G)**\
I'm just a **(F)** sad **(C)** song **(G)**

### Verse 2: Elena Coats

With **(C)** you, I **(G)** fall\
It's like I'm **(Am)** leaving all my past in **(F)** silhouettes up on the wall\
With **(C)** you, I'm a beautiful **(G)** mess\
It's like we're **(Am)** standing hand in hand with all our **(F)** fears up on the edge

### Pre-Chorus: Elena Coats

**(F)** So stop time right here in  **(G)** the moonlight\
'Cause I don't **(Am)** ever wanna close my eyes **(Bb)**

### Chorus: We The Kings

Without **(F)** you, I feel **(C)** broke\
Like **(G)** I'm half of a whole\
Without **(F)** you, I've **(C)** got no hand to **(G)** hold\
Without **(F)** you, I feel **(C)** torn\
Like a **(G)** sail **(Am)** in a **(G)** **(F)** storm\
Without **(G)** you, I'm just a sad song

### Verse 3: We The Kings & Elena Coats

**(Em)** You're the perfect **(F)** melody\
The only **(C)** harmony\
I wanna **(G)** hear\
**(Em)** You're my favorite part of **(F)** me\
With you standing next **(C)** to me\
I've got nothing to fear

### Chorus: We The Kings & Elena Coats

Without **(F)**  you, I feel **(C)** broke\
Like **(G)** I'm half of a whole\
Without **(F)** you, I've **(C)** got no hand to **(G)** hold\
Without **(F)** you, I feel **(C)** torn\
Like a **(E)** sail in **(Am)** a **(G)** storm **(F)**\
Without **(F)** you, I feel **(C)** broke\
Like **(G)** I'm half of a whole\
Without **(F)** you, I've got **(C)**  no hand to **(G)** hold\
Without **(F)** you, I feel **(C)** torn\
Like a **(G)** sail in **(Am)** a **(G)** storm **(F)**\
Without **(G)** you, I'm just a **(F)** sad **(C)** song **(G)**\
I'm just a **(F)** sad **(C)** song **(G)**
