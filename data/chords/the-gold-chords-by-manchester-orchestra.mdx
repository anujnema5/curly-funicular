**Intro** - **(C)** **(Em)** **(G)** **(C)** **(C)** **(Em)** **(G)** **(C)**

### \[Verse\]

**(C)** Couldn't really love you **(Em)** anymore, you've **(G)** become my ceiling\
**(C)** I don't think I love you **(Em)** anymore, that **(G)** gold mine changed you\
**(C)** You don't have to hold me **(Em)** anymore, our **(G)** cave's collapsing\
**(C)** I don't wanna be me **(Em)** anymore, my **(G)** old man told me

### \[Pre-Chorus\]

**(C)** You don't open your **(Em)** eyes for\
a while, you just **(G)** breathe that moment down **(C)**\
**(C)** Forty miles out of **(D)** East Illinois for my **(G)** old man's heart attack **(C)**

### \[Chorus\]

I **(G)** believed **(Em)** you were crazy **(C)**\
You **(Em)** believed that you love **(C)** me\
**(C)** **(Em)** **(G)** **(C)** **(C)** **(Em)** **(G)** **(C)**

### \[Verse\]

**(C)** I don't wanna bark here **(Em)** anymore, black **(G)** hills, the colly\
**(C)** Wasn't really dangerous for **(Em)** us, we just **(G)** catch you coughing\
**(C)** What the hell are we gonna **(Em)** do, a black **(G)** mile to the surface\
**(C)** I don't wanna be here **(Em)** anymore, it all **(G)** tastes like poison

### \[Pre-Chorus\]

**(C)** You can't open your **(Em)** eyes for a\
while, you just **(G)** breathe that moment down **(C)**\
**(C)** Forty hours out of **(D)** Homestake and\
I'm trying to **(G)**translate you again **(C)**

### \[Chorus\]

I **(G)** believed **(Em)** you were crazy **(C)**\
**(C)** You **(Em)** believed that you **(G)** love me **(C)**\
**(C)** You and **(Em)** me, we're a **(G)** daydrink **(C)**\
So **(C)** close your **(Em)**faith in **(G)** me **(C)**

### \[Bridge\]

**(C)** Ah-ah **(D)** ah-ah ah-ah **(G)** ah-ah **(C)** ah-ah-ah\
**(C)** Ah-ah **(D)** ah-ah ah-ah **(G)** ah-ah **(C)** ah-ah-ah\
**(C)** You can't open your **(D)** eyes for a\
while, you just **(G)** beat that moment down **(C)**\
**(C)** You can't open your **(D)** eyes for a while, you just **(G)** **(C)** breathe

### \[Chorus\]

**(C)** I **(Em)** believed you were **(G)** crazy **(C)**\
**(C)** You **(Em)**believed that you **(G)** love me **(C)**\
**(C)** You and **(Em)** me, we're a **(G)** daydrink **(C)**\
So **(C)** lose your **(Em)** faith in **(G)** me **(C)**\
**(C)** Lose your **(Em)** faith in **(G)**me **(C)**\
Oh **(C)** lose your **(Em)** faith in **(G)**me **(C)**\
**(C)** **(Em)** **(G)** **(C)** **(C)** **(Em)** **(G)** **(C)**
