### Chorus

**(Dmaj7)** Don't wanna sober up\
The sun is **(A)** killin' my buzz, that's why they call it mourning\
**(Dmaj7)** Thought I was strong enough\
Threw my **(A)** bottle at the sky, said, "God, that's a warning"\
**(Dmaj7)** Don't wanna sober up\
Try to keep it inside, but I **(D)** just wanna pour it\
**(A)** Thought I was strong enough\
Got a lotta shit to say, couldn't fit it in the chorus

### Verse 1

**(Dmaj7)** I just left Wally's, spent a Maserati\
The way I gotta flex, you'd think I did Pilates\
I call my **(A)** quote-unquote friends, "Do you got plans?"\
Turns out everyone's free when the dinner is\
**(Dmaj7)** Then they drag me to a party out in Malibu\
After thirty High Noons, it was pretty cool\
**(A)** Tried to shoot my shot, she told me that she had a shoot\
Bye-bye **(Damn)**

Got a lotta shit to say, couldn't fit it in the chorus

### Verse 2

**(Dmaj7)** Stumblin' down the corridor, came across an open door\
**(A)** Throwin' up is easy and who put on the Commodores?\
**(Dmaj7)** That's a nice tile floor, wish I got to know you more\
**(A)** Who am I talkin' to? Nobody\
**(Dmaj7)** Take me outside, I'm a little too high\
**(Dmaj7)** Paid a little too much for the time of my life\
When **(A)** money ain't a problem, everyone's lyin'\
**(A)** Even when I tell myself that I

### Chorus
