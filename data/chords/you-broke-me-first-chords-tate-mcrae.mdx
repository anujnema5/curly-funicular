### Intro

**(C#m)** **(A)** **(E)** **(B)**
You broke me first

### Verse 1

**(C#m)** Maybe you don't like talking too much **(A)** about yourself\
But you **(E)** should have told me\
That you were thinking **(B)** 'bout someone else\
You're **(C#m)** drunk at a party\
Or maybe it's just that your **(A)** car broke down\
Or your **(E)** phone's been off for a couple of months\
So you're **(B)** calling me now

### Pre chorus

**(C#m)** I know you, you're like **(A)** this\
When **(E)** shit don't go your way you needed **(B)** me to fix it\
**(C#m)** And like me, I **(A)** did\
But **(E)** I ran out of every **(B)** reason

### Chorus

Now suddenly you're **(C#m)** asking for it **(A)** back\
Could you tell me, **(E)** where'd you get the **(B)** nerve?\
Yeah, you could say you **(C#m)** miss all that we **(A)** had\
But I don't really **(E)** care how bad it **(B)** hurts\
When you broke me **(C#m)** **(A)** first\
You broke me **(E)** **(B)** first

### Verse 2

**(C#m)** Took a while, was in denial when **(A)** I first heard\
That **(E)** you moved on quicker than I could've ever\
You **(B)** know that hurt\
**(C#m)** Swear, for a while I would stare at my phone\
Just to **(A)** see your name\
But **(E)** now that it's there, I don't really know what **(B)** to say

### Pre chorus

**(C#m)** I know you, you're like **(A)** this\
When **(E)** shit don't go your way you needed **(B)** me to fix it\
**(C#m)** And like me, I **(A)** did\
But **(E)** I ran out of every **(B)** reason

### Chorus

Now suddenly you're **(C#m)** asking for it **(A)** back\
Could you tell me, **(E)** where'd you get the **(B)** nerve?\
Yeah, you could say you **(C#m)** miss all that we **(A)** had\
But I don't really **(E)** care how bad it **(B)** hurts\
When you broke me **(C#m)** **(A)** first\
You broke me **(E)** **(B)** first

### Bridge

What did you think would **(C#m)** **(A)** happen?\
What did you think would **(E)** **(B)** happen?\
I'll never let you **(C#m)** have **(A)** it\
What did you think would **(E)** **(B)** happen?

### Chorus

Now suddenly you're **(C#m)** asking for it **(A)** back\
Could you tell me, **(E)** where'd you get the **(B)** nerve?\
Yeah, you could say you **(C#m)** miss all that we **(A)** had\
But I don't really **(E)** care how bad it **(B)** hurts\
When you broke me **(C#m)** **(A)** first - You broke me first\
You broke me **(E)** **(B)** first, ooh oh
