I'm digging through the **(E)** glove box **(C#m)**\

I bought the car my **(G#m)** junior year **(F#)**\
There's candy in my **(E)** backpack **(C#m)**\
And you can pick our **(G#m)** soundtrack **(F#)**\
We're heading for the **(E)** East Coast **(C#m)** tonight\
So pack your **(G#m)** bags and hold on **(F#)** tight\

**(E)** Run **(B)** away with me\
We're on the way to **(F#)** New York City\

Manhattan never **(F#)** looked so pretty\
**(E)** Travel light and **(B)** see the world right\
You'll never know if you **(F#)** never go, so\

And say, "Hello," to **(F#)** New York City **(B)**

Feet up on the **(E)** dashboard **(C#m)**\
We're driving with the **(G#m)** windows down **(F#)**\
Did you forget your **(E)** phone cord? **(C#m)**\
We'll buy one in the **(G#m)** next small town **(F#)**\
Get dinner at an **(E)** IHOP **(C#m)**\
A shower at a **(G#m)** truck stop **(F#)**\
We'll listen to some **(E)** Johnny Cash **(C#m)**\
Take my **(G#m)** hand and don't look **(F#)** back\
'Cause we're moving on **(E)** \[da-da-da-da **(C#m)**, da-da-da\] **(G#m)** **(F#)**\
We're moving on **(E)** \[da-da-da-da **(C#m)**, da-da-da\] **(G#m)** **(F#)**

We're on the way to **(F#)** New York City\
**(E)** Take my **(B)** hand and see **(G#m)**\
Manhattan never **(F#)** looked so pretty\
**(E)** Travel light and **(B)** see the world right\

**(E)** Stroll the **(B)** midtown streets\
And tell me that you **(F#)** don't feel giddy\
**(E)** Lady **(B)** Liberty **(G#m)** ain't throwing us a **(F#)** wink or is she?\
