### Verse

**(A#maj7)** Sorry, sorry I don't think that I\
**(Gm7)** Can make it to the plans we made\
Something **(D#maj7)** came up, I'm bogged down\
Got so much work that I just found\
a **(D#7)** trip outside I can't allow\
**(A#maj7)** Maybe, maybe if I planned ahead\
I'd **(Gm7)** feel a little more at ease\
**(D#maj7)** When I talk about my plans and why\
I can't come out tonight\
I **(D#7)** laugh when I fall for my own lies

### Chorus

I can't leave **(A#maj7)** my room -I can't leave my room\
I've got so **(Gm7)** many things I've gotta do\
**(D#maj7)** Checklist on the wall -The wall
**(D#7)** Oh you seem rather tall\
I can't leave my **(A#maj7)** room -I can't leave my room\
I made a **(Gm7)** daily schedule yesterday\
Even if I **(D#7)** missed the first thing on the list\
And the **(D#maj7)** hundred today got-to-do bits\
**(D#7)** I'm sure tomorrow's the day\
I can't leave my **(A#maj7)** room....\

### Instrumental

**(A#maj7)** **(Gm7)** **(D#maj7)** **(D#7)**

### Verse

**(A#maj7)** You know, you know that I'm gonna try\
But **(Gm7)** it seems that I've wasted time\
See **(D#maj7)** I lack in planning expertise\
But excel in procrastinating\
**(D#7)** It's all on me\
**(A#maj7)** Please don't think that I don't care at all\
If **(Gm7)** I could I'd be out that door\
But **(D#maj7)** you know that I've gotta stay\
'Cause I've got too much on my plate\
**(D#7)** I said that yesterday...

### Chorus

I can't leave **(A#maj7)** my room -I can't leave my room\
I've got so **(Gm7)** many things I've gotta do\
**(D#maj7)** Checklist on the wall -The wall\
**(D#7)** Oh you seem rather tall\
I can't leave my **(A#maj7)** room -I can't leave my room\
I made a **(Gm7)** daily schedule yesterday

Even if I **(D#7)** missed the first thing on the list\
And the **(D#maj7)** hundred today got-to-do bits\
**(D#7)** I'm sure tomorrow's the day\
I can't leave my **(A#maj7)** room.....\
I swear I swear I **(Gm7)** can't leave my room\
Lah **(D#maj7)** dah dee dah -Lah dah dee dah\
Lah dah dee dah -Lah
