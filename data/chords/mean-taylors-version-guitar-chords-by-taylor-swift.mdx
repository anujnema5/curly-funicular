### Verse 1

**(C#m)** You, **(B)** with your words like knives\
**(A)** And swords and weapons that you use against me\
**(C#m)** You have **(B)** knocked me off my **(A)** feet again\
**(A)** Got me feelin' like a **(C#m)** nothing\
**(C#m)** You, **(B)** with your voice like nails on a **(A)** chalkboard\
**(A)** Calling me out when I'm wounded\
**(C#m)** You, **(B)** pickin' on the **(A)** weaker man

### Pre Chorus

**(B)** Well, you can take me down\
**(E)** With just one **(A)** single **(B)** blow\
**(B)** But you don't know what you **(A)** don't know

### Chorus

**(E)** Someday, **(B)** I'll be **(C#m)** livin' in a big ole **(A)** city\
**(A)** And **(E)** all you're **(B)** ever gonna be is **(A)** mean\
**(E)** Someday, **(B)** I'll be **(C#m)** big enough so you can't **(A)** hit me\
**(E)** And all you're **(B)** ever gonna be is **(A)** mean\
**(A)** Why you gotta be so **(E)** mean?

### Verse 2

**(C#m)** You, with **(B)** your switching sides\
**(A)** And your wildfire lies and your humiliation\
**(C#m)** You have **(B)** pointed out my **(A)** flaws again\
**(A)** As if I don't already see them\
**(C#m)** I walk with my head **(B)** down, trying to **(A)** block you out\
**(A)** Cause I'll never **(C#m)** impress you\
**(C#m)** I just wanna feel **(A)** okay again

### Pre Chorus

**(B)** I bet you got pushed **(E)** around\
**(A)** Somebody made you **(B)** cold\
**(B)** But the cycle ends right now\
**(A)** Cause you can't lead me down that road\
And you don't know what you don't know

### Chorus

**(E)** Someday, **(B)** I'll be **(C#m)** livin' in a big ole **(A)** city\
**(E)** And all you're ever **(B)** gonna be is **(A)** mean\
**(E)** Someday, **(B)** I'll be **(C#m)** big enough so you can't **(A)** hit me\
**(E)** And all you're **(B)** ever gonna be is **(A)** mean\
**(A)** Why you gotta be so **(E)** mean?

### Bridge

**(A)** And I can see **(B)** you years from now in a bar\
**(E)** Talking over a **(A)** football game\
**(B)** With that same big, loud opinion, but **(E)** nobody's **(A)** listening **(B)**\
**(B)** Washed up and ranting about the **(C#m)** same ole **(B)** bitter **(A)** things\
**(B)** Drunk and grumbling on about how **(C#m)** I can't **(A)** sing\
**(A)** But all you are is **(E)** mean

### Builtup

**(A)** All you are is **(E)** mean\
**(B)** And a liar, **(C#m)** and pathetic\
**(A)** And alone in life, and **(E)** mean\
**(E)** And **(B)** mean, **(C#m)** and mean, **(A)** and mean

### Chorus

**(E)** Someday, **(B)** I'll be **(A)** livin' in a big ole city\
**(E)** And all you're ever **(B)** gonna be is **(A)** mean\
**(E)** Someday, **(B)** I'll be **(C#m)** big enough so you can't **(A)** hit me\
**(E)** And all you're **(B)** ever gonna be is **(A)** mean\
**(A)** Why you gotta be so **(E)** mean?\
**(E)** Someday, **(B)** I'll be **(C#m)** livin' in a big ole **(A)** city\
(Why you gotta be so mean?)\
**(E)** And all you're **(B)** ever gonna be is **(A)** mean\
(Why you gotta be so mean?)\
**(E)** Someday, **(B)** I'll be **(C#m)** big enough so you can't **(A)** hit me\
