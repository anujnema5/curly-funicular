### Intro:

**(D)** **(A)** **(Em)** **(G)**
Mmm,mmm,mmm

### Verse 1:

**(D)** Flowers in **(A)** hand, waiting for **(Em)** me\
Every **(G)** word in **(D)** poetry\
Won't call me by **(A)** name, only **(Em)** "Baby"\
The more that you **(G)** give the less that I **(Bm)** need

### Pre-Chorus:

**(Bm)** Everyone **(A)** says I look **(G)** happy\
When **(Gm)** it feels right

### Chorus:

**(D)** I know that you're **(A)** wrong for me\
Gonna **(Em)** wish we never met on the **(G)** day I leave\
**(D)** I brought you down **(A)** to your knees\
'Cause they **(Em)** say that misery loves **(G)** company\
It's **(D)** not your fault I ruin **(A)** everything\
And it's **(Em)** not your fault I can't be what you **(G)** need\
Baby, **(Bm)** angels like you can't **(A)** fly down here with **(G)** me\
I'm **(Gm)** everything they said I would **(D)** be**(A)**\
La-la-la**(Em)**\
I'm **(G)** everything they said I would be

### Verse 2:

**(D)** I'll put you down **(A)** slow, love you, **(Em)** goodbye\
Before you let **(G)** go, just one more **(D)** time\
Take off your **(A)** clothes, pretend that it's **(Em)** fine\
A little more **(G)** hurt won't kill you

**(Bm)** Tonight mother says **(A)** "You don't look **(G)** happy"\
**(Gm)** Close your eyes

### Chorus:

**(D)** I know that you're **(A)** wrong for me\
Gonna **(Em)** wish we never met on the **(G)** day I leave\
**(D)** I brought you down to **(A)** your knees\
'Cause they **(Em)** say that misery loves **(G)** company\
It's **(D)** not your fault I ruin **(A)** everything\
And it's **(Em)** not your fault I can't be what you **(G)** need\
Baby, **(Bm)** angels like you can't **(A)** fly down here with **(G)** me\
I'm **(Gm)** everything they said I would be

### Interlude:

**(D)** **(A)** **(Em)** **(G)** x3

### Chorus:

**(D)** I know that you're **(A)** wrong for me\
Gonna **(Em)** wish we never met on the **(G)** day I leave\
**(D)** I brought you down **(A)** to your knees\
'Cause they **(Em)** say that misery loves **(G)** company\
It's **(D)** not your fault I ruin **(A)** everything\
And it's **(Em)** not your fault I can't be what you **(G)** need\
Baby, **(Bm)** angels like you can't **(A)** fly down here with **(G)** me, oh-oh

### Outro:

**(Bm)** Angels like you can't\
**(A)** fly down hell with **(G)** me
