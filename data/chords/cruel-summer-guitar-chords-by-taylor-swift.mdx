### Intro

**(G)** [Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah]

### Verse 1

**(C)**Fever dream high **(D)**in the quiet of the night\
You **(Bm)**know that I caught it **(Em)**[oh yeah, you’re right, I want it]\
**(C)**Bad, bad boy, **(D)**shiny toy with a price\
You **(Bm)**know that I bought it **(Em)**[oh yeah, you’re right, I want it]

### Pre-Chorus 1

Killing me **(C)**slow, out the **(D)**window\
I’m always waiting **(Bm)**for you to be waiting **(Em)**below\
Devils roll the **(C)**dice, angels roll their eyes\
What doesn’t **(D)**kill me makes me want you more

### Chorus 1

And it’s **(G)**new, the shape of your body\
It’s **(Bm)**blue, the feeling I’ve got\
And it’s **(Em)**ooh-ooh ooh whoa-oh\
It’s a **(C)**cruel summer\
It’s **(G)**cool, that’s what I tell ’em\
No **(Bm)**rules, unbreakable heaven\
But **(Em)**ooh-ooh ooh whoa-oh\
It’s a **(C)**cruel summer, with **(G)**you

### Verse 2

**(C)**Hang your head low **(D)**in the glow of the vending **(Bm)**machine\
I’m not buying **(oh **(Em)**yeah, you’re right, I want it)**\
You **(C)**say that we’ll just **(D)**screw it up in these trying **(Bm)**times\
We’re not trying **(oh **(Em)**yeah, you’re right, I want it)**

### Pre-Chorus 2

So cut the **(C)**headlights, summer’s **(D)**a knife\
I’m always waiting **(Bm)**for you just to cut **(Em)**to the bone\
Devils roll the **(C)**dice [dice], angels roll their eyes [eyes]\
And if I **(D)**bleed, you’ll be the last to know

### Chorus 2

Oh it’s **(G)**new, the shape of your body\
It’s **(Bm)**blue, the feeling I’ve got\
And it’s **(Em)**ooh-ooh ooh whoa-oh\
It’s a **(C)**cruel summer\
It’s **(G)**cool, that’s what I tell ’em\
No **(Bm)**rules, unbreakable heaven\
But **(Em)**ooh-ooh ooh whoa-oh\
It’s a **(C)**cruel summer, **(G)**with you

### Bridge

**(G)** I’m drunk in the back of the car\
And I **(Bm)**cried like a baby coming home from the bar **(oh)**\
**(Em)** Said I’m fine, but it wasn’t true\
I don’t **(C)**wanna keep secrets just to keep you\
And **(G)**I snuck in through the garden gate\
Every **(Bm)**night that summer just to seal my fate **(oh)**\
**(Em)** And I screamed for whatever it’s worth\
“I **(C)**love you,” ain’t that the worst thing you ever **(N.C.)**heard?\
He looks up, grinning like a devil

It’s **(G)**new, the shape of your body\
It’s **(Bm)**blue, the feeling I’ve got\
And it’s **(Em)**ooh-ooh ooh whoa-oh\
It’s a **(C)**cruel summer\
It’s **(G)**cool, that’s what I tell ’em\
No **(Bm)**rules, unbreakable heaven\
But **(Em)**ooh-ooh ooh whoa-oh\
It’s a **(C)**cruel summer, **(G)**with you

### Outro

**(G)** I’m drunk in the back of the car\
And I **(Bm)**cried like a baby coming home from the bar **(oh)**\
**(Em)** Said I’m fine, but it wasn’t true\
I don’t **(C)**wanna keep secrets just to keep you\
And **(G)**I snuck in through the garden gate\
Every **(Bm)**night that summer just to seal my fate **(oh)**\
**(Em)** And I screamed for whatever it’s worth\
“I **(C)**love you,” ain’t that the worst thing you ever **(G)**heard?\
