### Verse 1

**(Am)** Maybe **(F)** I was wrong and you were **(C)** right\

**(C)** I just wanna **(Em)** feel like I **(Dm)** belong\
**(Am)** And **(F)** every time my **(F)** heart swings back to **(C)** you\
**(C)** You are my **(F)** morning and my **(C)** truth\
**(C)** And all that I can **(Em)** do is sing this **(Dm)** song\
**(Dm)** It ain't that **(G)** long, hm

### Chorus

**(C)** And nothing says **(F)** "I love you" like your **(C)** eyes\
**(C)** Fill my lips with **(F)** carbon diox-**(C)** ide\
**(C)** I just wanna feel like **(Cm)** I deserve **(Dm)** you\
**(Dm)** Cause you deserve **(G)** me\
**(C)** Baby, **(F)** it's the way that you can **(C)** see\
**(C)** What I miss and what **(F)** I can never **(C)** be\

**(Dm)** Cause **(G)** you deserve me

### Verse 2

**(Am)** Maybe you were **(F)** wrong and I was **(C)** right\
**(C)** I don't care, won't you **(F)** stay another **(C)** night?\
**(C)** I just need some **(Em)** time to be **(Dm)** myself\
**(Am)** I couldn't say **(F)** "I need you" on that **(C)** night\
**(C)** When you left **(F)** and I lost all track of **(C)** time\
**(C)** I just want you **(Em)** close so **(Dm)** I can feel you\
**(Dm)** Can you feel **(G)** me? Mm

### Chorus

**(C)** And nothing says **(F)** "I love you" like the **(C)** words\
**(C)** That were **(F)** never said, but could be **(C)** heard\
**(C)** If only there was **(Cm)** peace around us, **(Dm)** baby\
**(G)** You would hear me\
**(C)** And maybe it's the **(F)** way that lovers **(C)** do\
**(C)** I just want for me **(F)** what I want for **(C)** you\
**(C)** Only with the **(Cm)** sun above **(Em)** us **(Dm)** maybe\
**(Dm)** You would **(G)** see me

### Post Chorus

**(Am)** Mm, **(F)** mm, **(C)** mm **(F)**\
**(C)** Mm, **(Em)** Mm, **(Dm)** **(G)**

### Bridge

**(C)** And even **(F)** if you leave, I may be **(C)** fine\
**(C)**  Cause my heart, **(F)** it has its own **(C)** design\
**(C)** And even if you **(Em)** never see it, **(Dm)** baby\
**(Dm)** You're all that I **(G)** need

### Chorus

**(C)** Maybe it's the **(F)** silence in your **(C)** eyes\
**(C)** Maybe it's the **(F)** lilac when you're **(C)** shy\
**(C)** Maybe it's the **(F)** mystery of your **(C)** love\
**(C)** All I **(F)** need is a sign from the stars **(C)** above\
**(C)** Maybe it's the **(F)** way that you breathe in **(C)** me\
**(C)** Maybe it's the **(F)** man that you see in **(C)** me\
**(C)** Maybe it's the **(F)** fragrance of your **(C)**  hair\
**(C)** Yeah, I just wanna **(F)** kiss you when you're **(C)** there
