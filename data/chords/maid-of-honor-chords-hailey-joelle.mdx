### Verse 1

**(C)** I knew that we'd grow up, **(Fm)** didn't know\
**(F)** we'd grow **(C)** apart\
**(G)** Why does looking at our **(Am)** pictures now\
**(F)** have to be this **(C)** hard?\
**(C)** The heart key chain on my bag, you still\
**(F)** have the **(C)** other half\
**(G)** And those jokes you told, **(Am)** sixteen years old\
**(F)** they all still make me **(C)** laugh\
**(C)** And you **(G)** didn't try to **(Am)** say goodbye\
**(F)** that's why this hurts so **(C)** bad

### Chorus

**(C)** They **(G)** tell you how to **(Am)** break-up with a\
**(F)** boy but not a **(C)** friend\
**(C)** What happens **(G)** when what gets you through the\
**(Am)** heartbreak is what's\
**(F)** coming to an **(C)** end?\
**(C)** You **(G)** only live a **(Am)** state away and\
**(F)** God knows, I know **(C)** people change\
**(G)** But lately, I've been **(Am)** feeling like I **(F)** lost her\
**(C)** What happened to my **(Fm)** maid of **(C)** honor?

### Verse 2

**(C)** Thе last time I went home, **(F)** yеah, that's when I was **(C)** sure\
**(C)** Don't know **(G)** what it was **(Am)** but it sure wasn't\
**(F)** what it was **(C)** before\
**(C)** And I hate how much I miss you, **(F)** hated seeing you **(C)** cry\
**(C)** No more **(G)** staying up and **(Am)** wondering what our\
**(F)** futures will look **(C)** like\
**(C)** No more **(G)** talking about **(Am)** what you'll wear\
**(F)** the day I'm dressed in **(C)** white

### Chorus

**(C)** They **(G)** tell you how to **(Am)** break-up with a\
**(F)** boy but not a **(C)** friend\
**(C)** What happens **(G)** when what gets you through the\
**(Am)** heartbreak is what's **(F)** coming to an **(C)** end?\
**(C)** You **(G)** only live a **(Am)** state away and\
**(F)** God knows, I know **(C)** people change\
**(G)** But lately, I've been **(Am)** feeling like I **(F)** lost her\
**(C)** What happened to my **(Fm)** maid of **(C)** honor?

### Post Chorus

**(C)** Hmm-**(G)** mm, **(Am)** hmm\
**(F)** Hmm-**(C)** mm, **(G)** hmm\
**(Am)** Hmm-**(F)** mm, **(C)** hmm,  mm-mm-mm-mm\
**(G)** Hmm-mm

### Outro

**(G)** You were all of my **(Am)** good old days\
**(F)** and God knows, I know **(C)** people change\
**(G)** But lately, I've been **(Am)** feeling like I\
**(F)** lost her, I **(Dm)** want her\
**(C)** Oh, what happened to my maid of honor?
