### Intro -

**(G)** **(Em)** **(Bm)** **(D)**

### Verse 1

I don't live in Cali **(G)** fornia, I'll inform you, that's not where **(Em)** I reside\
I'm just a **(Bm)** tenant, paying rent inside this **(D)** body and I\
Got two **(G)** windows, and those windows, well, I **(Em)** call them my eyes\
I'm just **(Bm)** going where the **(D)** wind blows, I don't get to decide

### Pre-Chorus

**(G)** Sometimes, I think too much, **(Em)** yeah, I get so caught up\
**(Bm)** I'm always stuck in my head\
**(G)** I wish I could escape, **(Em)** I tried to yesterday\
**(Bm)** Took all the sheets off my **(B)** bed

### Chorus

Then I **(G)** tied up my linen with **(Em)** five strips of ribbon I **(Bm)** found **(D)**\
Scaled the **(G)** side of the building, I **(Em)** ran to the hills 'til they **(Bm)** found me **(B)** \
And they put me **(G)** back in my cell, **(Em)** all by myself\
**(Bm)**  Alone with my thoughts **(D)** again\
Guess my **(G)** mind is a prison and **(Em)** I'm never gonna get **(Bm)** out **(B)**

### Verse 2

So they tranqui **(G)** lized me, analyzed me, threw me **(Em)** back in my cage\
Then they **(Bm)** tied me to an IV, told me **(D)** I was insane\
I'm a **(G)** prisoner, a visitor **(Em)** inside of my brain\
And no **(Bm)** matter what I do, they try to **(D)** keep me in chains

### Pre-Chorus

**(G)** Sometimes, I think too much, **(Em)** yeah, I get so caught up\
**(Bm)** I'm always stuck in my head\
**(G)** I wish I could escape, **(Em)** I tried to yesterday\
**(Bm)** Took all the sheets off my **(B)** bed

### Chorus

Then I **(G)** tied up my linen with **(Em)** five strips of ribbon I **(Bm)** found **(D)**\
Scaled the **(G)** side of the building, I **(Em)** ran to the hills til they **(Bm)** found me **(B)** \
And they put me **(G)** back in my cell, **(Em)** all by myself\
**(Bm)**  Alone with my thoughts **(D)** again\
Guess my **(G)** mind is a prison and **(Em)** I'm never gonna get **(Bm)** out **(B)**
