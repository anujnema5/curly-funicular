### \[Verse 1\]

**(F)** If I had a sister, I might be with her \
**(Bbmaj7)** Out at a bar, talking 'bout a broken **(F)** heart \
**(F)** If she was married, it'd make me happy **(F)** I'd be by her \
**(Bbmaj7)** side, she'd make a beautiful **(F)** bride

### \[Pre-Chorus\]

**(C)** She'd be my built-in best friend **(Dm7)** Right around my age \
**(C)** She would know how hard it's been **(Bb)** Cause we grew up the same way

### \[Chorus\]

**(F)** People would say we look like each other \
**(A7)** Got the same brown eyes as our mother \
**(Bb)** Someone who's been there bеfore \
**(Bb)** Caught sneakin' in the  **(Bbm)** samе backdoor \
**(F)** Going back home would be a lot better \
**(A7)** When our parents fight, we'd just **(Bb)** smile \
**(Bb)** It gets lonely **(Bbm)** being an only **(F)** child

### \[Verse 2\]

**(F)** If I had a brother, a little bit younger \
**(Bb)** He might act tough, every time I fell in **(F)** love \
**(F)** Yeah, he would be taller and help with our father \
**(Bb)** When we got old, I wouldn't have to do it **(F)** alone

### \[Pre-Chorus\]

**(C)** He'd be my built-in best friend \
**(Dm7)** Right around my age \
**(C)** Know he'd be a gentleman \
**(Bb)** 'Cause we grew up the same way

### \[Chorus\]

**(F)** People would say we look like each other \
**(A7)** Got the same brown eyes as our mother \
**(Bb)** Someone who's been there before \
**(Bb)** Caught sneakin' in the **(Bbm)** same backdoor \
**(F)** Going back home would be a lot better \
**(A7)** When our parents fight, we'd just **(Bb)** smile \
**(Bb)** It gets lonely being an **(Bbm)** only **(F)** child

### \[Outro\]

**(A7)** Hmm, **(Bb)** hmm **(Bb)** \
It gets lonely being an **(Bbm)** only **(F)** child
