**Intro** - **(D)** **(Bm)**

### \[Verse 1\]

**(D)** I was never the one **(Bm)** to write up a song for **(D)** just anyone, I\
I was always the **(A)** one to **(Bm)** find myself lost in **(D)** old conversations, oh\
'Cause I've always been **(A)** told that **(Bm)** things will unfold if **(D)** you keep on waiting\
But then you came **(A)** along and **(Bm)** proved me all wrong, **(D)** I was so mistaken

### \[Chorus\]

**(G)** 'Cause you, glue all the **(D)** pieces back to **(A)** gether\
**(G)** Yeah you, you take all my **(D)** wrongs and make them **(A)** better\
**(G)** Yeah you, you're making me **(D)** wanna try for **(A)** ever\
And **(G)** I feel so free, **(A)** oh, my sweet **(D)** baby

### \[Verse 2\]

**(D)** I was never the one **(Bm)** to give up the ghost, **(A)** no, I was so stuck, I\
**(D)** Kept on playing my part **(Bm)** wanting to give up **(A)** 'cause nothing was changing\
**(D)** But with you, **(A)** it's so clear and now **(Bm)** that you're here, I see **(A)** colors in\
every **(D)** spectrum\
Guess I finally I **(Bm)** learned my **(A)** lesson

### \[Chorus\]

**(G)** 'Cause you, glue all the **(D)** pieces back to **(A)** gether\
**(G)** Yeah you, you take all my **(D)** wrongs and make them **(A)** better\
**(G)** Yeah you, you're making me **(D)** wanna try for **(A)** ever\
And **(G)** I feel so free, **(A)** oh, my sweet **(D)** baby

### \[Bridge\]

**(G)** And I think to myself\
**(A)** And I'm thinking out loud\
**(G)** We won't need nothing else\
**(A)** For the rest of our time\
**(G)** And I know it so well\
**(Am)** I will always be **(A)** by your side **(E)**

### \[Chorus\]

**(G)** 'Cause you, glue all the **(D)** pieces back to **(A)** gether\
**(G)** Yeah you, you take all my **(D)** wrongs and make them **(A)** better\
**(G)** Yeah you, you're making me **(D)** wanna try for **(A)** ever\
And **(G)** I feel so free, **(A)** oh, my sweet **(D)** baby

### \[Chorus\]

**(G)** 'Cause you, glue all the **(D)** pieces back to **(A)** gether\
**(G)** Yeah you, you take all my **(D)** wrongs and make them **(A)** better\
**(G)** Yeah you, you're making me **(D)** wanna try for **(A)** ever\
And **(G)** I feel so free, **(A)** oh, my sweet **(D)** baby
