**Intro** - **(G)** **(D)** **(G)** **(D)**

### Verse 1

**(Cmaj7)** There's traffic on the bridge\
But the **(Em)** skyline shines with a **(D)** certain light\
And I **(Cmaj9)** know you're sick of **(Cmaj7)** it\
But I **(Em)** know a happy hour **(D)** nearby

### Pre-Chorus

**(C)** And there's a possibility\
That one **(Em)** day, things'll get **(D)** better\
For the **(C)** huddled masses in between\
The **(Em)** shadows and the **(D)** stars

### Chorus

Floa**(G)**ting empire\
Held up by **(D)** fraying wire\
I'll **(C)** cover you in winter\
Like a **(Em)** blanket by the **(D)** fire\
And when the **(G)** rent's too high\
We'll just buy cheaper **(Bm)** wine\
And **(C)** hang on to see if whether\
Cons**(Em)**tellations hold **(D)** together or not **(Cmaj7)**

### Verse 2

Four **(C)** years in Brooklyn\
**(Em7)** And happy **(D)** birthday, darling\
When **(C)** we feel young again\
**(Em)** I'd like to **(D)** take you dancing

### Pre-Chorus

'Cause **(C)** there's a possibility\
That **(Em7)** one day, things'll get **(D)** better\
For the **(C)** huddled masses in between\
The **(Em)** shadows and the **(D)** stars\
And **(C)** there's a possibility\
That we'll **(Em7)** both go down **(D)** together\
Or free **(Csus2)** ourselves from **(C)** gravity\
And **(Em)** tumble through the **(D)** dark

### Chorus

Floa**(G)**ting empire\
Held up by **(D)** fraying wire\
I'll **(C)** cover you in winter\
Like a **(Em)** blanket by the **(D)** fire\
And when the **(G)** rent's too high\
We'll just buy cheaper **(Bm)** wine\
And **(C)** hang on to see if whether\
Cons**(Em)**tellations hold **(D)** together or not **(Cmaj7)**

### Bridge

I **(C)** never placed too much faith in the **(D)** stars\
I never placed too much faith in **(C)** my heart\
But the **(Em)** siren call of the **(D)** chandelier city **(C)**\
And inch-by-inch, we're breaking **(Em)** apart\
As we're **(D)** rising through the **(Cmaj7)** dark\
From the **(Em)** sky, I bet the **(D)** lights look pretty **(Cmaj7)**

### Chorus

Floa**(G)**ting empire\
Held up by **(D)** fraying wire\
I'll **(C)** cover you in winter\
Like a **(Em)** blanket by the **(D)** fire\
And when the **(G)** rent's too high\
We'll just buy cheaper **(Bm)** wine\
And **(C)** hang on to see if whether\
Cons**(Em)**tellations hold **(D)** together or not **(Cmaj7)**\
Or **(Em)** Not **(D)** **(C)**..
