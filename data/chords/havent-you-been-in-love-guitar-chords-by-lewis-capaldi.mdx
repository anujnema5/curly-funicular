### Verse 1

**(Db)** Don't put your cover-up, **(Ab)** you know it's bad for your **(Bbm)** health\
**(Bbm)** And, when the going's tough, **(Gb)** you're way too **(Ab)** hard on **(Db)** yourself\
**(Db)** I wish you'd open up, **(Ab)** and I'd lend a little to **(Bbm)** help\
**(Bbm)** Before you dive off the **(Ab)** deep end

### Pre Chorus

**(Ab)** Well, you hold me like you **(Gb)** want me\
**(Db)** But you don't give me **(Ab)** nothin' else\
**(Bbm7)** Feel this happening, but you feel **(Gb)** absent\
**(Db)** Can you tell me what it **(Ab)** is?

### Chorus

**(Ab)** And she said **(Db)** this
**(Ab)** "Haven't you ever been in **(Bbm)** love before?\
**(Gb)** You heard 'em say, **(Db)** it takes the pain away\
**(Ab)** And it's a **(Bbm)** feelin' that you can't **(Gb)** ignore"\
**(Gb)** But it's more like a **(Db)** knife to me than a **(Ab)** high to me\
**(Bbm)** And my heart can't fall apart **(Gb)** anymore\
**(Gb)** If you **(Db)** knew what I knew, you'd be terrified\
**(Ab)** Haven't you ever been in **(Bbm)** love before?

### Verse 2

**(Db)** If we don't work it out, **(Ab)** that's something I could accept\
**(Bbm)** But I feel you're ruling out **(Gb)** a love that ain't happened yet\
**(Db)** And, maybe I'm a fool, **(Ab)** but I just can't live with **(Bbm)** regret\
**(Bbm)** I'd rather dive off the **(Gb)** deep end

### Pre-Chorus

**(Bbm)** Well, you hold me like you **(Gb)** want me\
**(Gb)** But you **(Db)** don't give me nothin' **(Ab)** else\
**(Ab)** Feel this **(Bbm)** happening, but you feel **(Gb)** absent\
**(Gb)** Can you **(Db)** tell me what it **(Ab)** is?

### Chorus

**(Ab)** And she said **(Db)** this
**(Ab)** "Haven't you ever been in **(Bbm)** love before?\
**(Gb)** You heard 'em say, **(Db)** it takes the pain away\
**(Ab)** And it's a **(Bbm)** feelin' that you can't **(Gb)** ignore"\
**(Gb)** But it's more like a **(Db)** knife to me than a **(Ab)** high to me\
**(Bbm)** And my heart can't fall apart **(Gb)** anymore\
**(Gb)** If you **(Db)** knew what I knew, you'd be terrified\
**(Ab)** Haven't you ever been in **(Bbm)** love before?
