### Verse

**(Bm)** Our first kiss was **(D)** Christmas in the **(G)** Walmart toy **(D)** department\
She said, **(G)** "I should take you **(D)** with me when I **(A)** leave"\
**(Bm)** We were searchin' **(D)** New York for a **(G)** fancy, new **(D)** apartment\
She said, **(G)** "Central Park in **(D)** Sea World for **(A)** trees"

### Chorus

You **(G)** ask about the **(D)** cows wearin' my **(A)** sweater\
It's **(Bm)** somethin' **(A)** about the **(G)** weather that **(D)** makes them lie **(A)** down\
The **(G)** only time I **(D)** feel I might get **(A)** better is **(Bm)** when we **(A)** are together **(Em)** **(F#m)** **(G)**

### Instrumental

**(Bm)** **(D)** **(G)** **(D)** **(G)** **(D)** **(A)**

### Verse

**(Bm)** I like socks with **(D)** sandals, she's morе **(G)** into scented **(D)** candles\
Oh, **(G)** I'll nеver get that **(D)** smell out of my **(A)** bag\
**(Bm)** It was poorly **(D)** handled\
The **(G)** day we both got **(D)** canceled\
Because **(G)** I'm a racist and **(D)** you're some kind of **(A)** slag

### Chorus

You **(G)** ask about the **(D)** cows wearin' my **(A)** sweater\
It's **(Bm)** somethin' **(A)** about the **(G)** weather that **(D)** makes them lie **(A)** down\
The **(G)** only time I **(D)** feel I might get **(A)** better is **(Bm)** when we **(A)** are together **(Em)** **(F#m)** **(G)** (Oh, together)

### Instrumental

**(Bm)** **(D)** **(G)** **(D)** **(G)** **(D)** **(A)**

### Bridge

**(Bm)** "I'm better at **(D)** writin'" was just a **(G)** way to get you **(D)** bitin'\
Oh, the **(G)** truth is that our **(D)** egos are **(A)** absurd\
**(Bm)** I thought we were **(D)** fightin'\
But it **(G)** seems I was **(D)** gaslightin' you\
I **(G)** didn't know that **(D)** it had its own **(A)** word\

### Chorus

You still **(G)** ask about the **(D)** cows wearin' my **(A)** sweater\
It's **(Bm)** something **(A)** about the **(G)** weather that **(D)** makes them lie down **(A)**\
The **(G)** only time I **(D)** feel I might get **(A)** better is **(Bm)** when we **(A)** are together **(Em)** **(F#m)** **(G)**
