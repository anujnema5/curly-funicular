Uh-uh, **(Bb)** **(Eb)** x2\

### Verse 1

**(Bb)** I still remember the look on your face\
**(Bb)** Lit **(Eb)** through the darkness at **(Gm7)** 1:58\
**(Eb)** The words that you whispered for just us to know\
**(Eb)** You told me **(Bb)** you **(F)** loved me, so why did you **(F5)** go **(Bb)** away?\
**(Eb)** **(Bb)** A- **(Gm)**way **(Gm7)**

**(Gm)** **(Eb)** x2\
**(Ebmaj7)**

### Verse 2

**(Eb)** I do recall now, the smell of the rain\
**(Gm)** Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane\
**(Eb)** That July ninth, the beat of your heart\
**(F)** It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms

### Pre Chorus

**(Eb)** But now I'll go\
**(Eb)** Sit on the floor wearing **(Bb)** your clothes\
**(Bb)** All that I know is I **(Eb)** don't know\
**(Eb)** How to be something you **(F)** miss

### Chorus

**(F)** I never thought we'd have a **(Bb)** last kiss\
**(Bb)** I never imagined we'd **(Gm)** end like **(Gm7)** this\
**(Eb)** Your name, forever the name on my **(F)** lips

### Verse 3

**(Bb)** I do remember the swing of your step\
**(Gm7)** The life of the party, you're showing off **(Gm)** again\
**(Eb)** And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in\
**(F)** I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did\
**(Bb)** Because I love your handshake, meeting my father\
**(Gm)** I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets\
**(Eb)** How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something\
**(F)** There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

### Pre Chorus

**(Eb)** And I'll go\
**(Eb)** Sit on the floor wearing **(Bb)** your clothes\
**(Bb)** All that I know is I **(Eb)** don't know\
**(Eb)** How to be something you **(F)** miss

### Chorus

**(F)** I never thought we'd have a **(Bb)** last kiss\
**(Bb)** I never imagined we'd **(Gm)** end **(Gm7)** like this\
**(Eb)** Your name, forever the name on my **(F)** lips, ooh

### Bridge

**(Bb)** So I'll **(Gm7)** watch your **(Gm)** life in **(Eb)** pictures like I used **(F)** to watch you **(Bb)** sleep\
**(Bb)** And I **(Gm)** feel you **(Ebmaj7)** forget me **(Eb)** like I **(F)** used to **(Bb)** feel you breathe\
**(Bb)** And I'll **(Gm7)** keep up with our old **(Eb)** friends just to **(F)** ask them how you **(Ebmaj7)** are\
**(Eb)** Hope it's nice **(F)** where you are

### Verse 4

**(Gm)** And I **(Eb)** hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day\
**(Bb)** And something reminds you you wish you had stayed\
**(Eb)** You can plan for a change in the weather and time\
**(Eb)** But I never planned on you **(F)** changing your mind

### Pre Chorus

**(F)** So, **(Eb)** I'll go\
**(Eb)** Sit on the floor wearing **(Bb)** your clothes\
**(Bb)** All that I know is I **(Eb)** don't know\
**(Eb)** How to be something you **(F)** miss

### Chorus

**(F)** I never thought we'd have a **(Bb)** last kiss\
**(Bb)** I never imagined we'd **(Gm)** end **(Gm7)** like **(Gm)** this\
**(Eb)** Your name, forever the name on my **(F)** lips

### Outro

**(F)** Just like our c last kiss
**(Eb)** Forever the **(Bb)** name on my **(Gm)** lips\
