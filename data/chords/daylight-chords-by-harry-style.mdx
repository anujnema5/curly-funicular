**Intro** - **(G)** **(Bm)** **(A)** **(F#m)**

### Verse 1

**(G)** Is there something in the air?\
**(Bm)** Feel the pressure in your stare\
**(A)** So close I can read your eyes\
**(F#m7)** Why now? Why not tonight?"\
**(G)** Have a good thing going now\
**(Bm)** The tension's growing wild\
**(A)** Our minds haven't caught up yet\
**(F#m7)** But, our hands are so direct

### Pre-Chorus

**(Bm)** And I know I know I know I know\
Should already **(A)** happen\
Now, we're taking **(F#m7)** action **(G)**\
And I **(Bm)** know I know I know I know\
Should've left it **(A)** open\
Now, we're losing **(A)** focus

### Chorus

Cuz **(G)** you're too close\
**(Bm)** Keep asking what I **(A)** want the most\
**(F#m)** I'm scared I'll **(G)** never let you go\
That's **(Bm)** why I never wanna **(A)** get this close\
**(Gmaj7)** You're too close\
**(Bm)** I hate it when you **(A)** give me hope\
**(F#m)** We both know how this **(Gmaj7)** story goes\
That's **(Bm)** why I never wanna **(A)** get this close, **(F#m)** this close

### Verse 2

**(Gmaj7)** Pretending I don't care\
**(Bm)** My emotions were prepared\
**(A)** To handle what would happen next\
**(F#m)** If I want more and you want less, yeah!

### Pre-Chorus

**(Bm)** And I know I know I know I know\
Should already **(A)** happen\
Now, we're taking **(F#m7)** action **(G)**\
And I **(Bm)** know I know I know I know\
Should've left it **(A)** open\
Now, we're losing **(A)** focus

### Chorus

Cuz **(G)** you're too close\
**(Bm)** Keep asking what I **(A)** want the most\
**(F#m)** I'm scared I'll **(G)** never let you go\
That's **(Bm)** why I never wanna **(A)** get this close\
**(Gmaj7)** You're too close\
**(Bm)** I hate it when you **(A)** give me hope\
**(F#m)** We both know how this **(Gmaj7)** story goes\
That's **(Bm)** why I never wanna **(A)** get this close, **(F#m)** this close

### Post-Chorus

Oh! **(Bm)** You're too close\
Oh! **(A)** You're too close
