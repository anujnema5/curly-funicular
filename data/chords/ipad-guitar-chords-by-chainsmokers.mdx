You’re living in a **(G)**past life, twenty-five **(Bm)**, all your friends are verified\

I'm looking at your **(G)**life through cellophane **(Bm)**, hoping things would stay the same\

You were just a **(G)**downtown socialitе,\
**(Bm)** ship I pass on summer nights\
**(D)**Shadow that I can't define **(A)**\
Turned into a **(G)**gaslight kerosene\
**(Bm)**, love that felt like seventeen\
**(D)**Hurt me 'til I feel alive **(A)**

where you go **(Bm)**, who you know now?\
You play the **(D)**same card,\
swear to god **(A)**, do you call him?

When it **(G)**all, yeah, when it **(Bm)** all falls apart\
Sometimes **(D)** you let go, just **(A)**to know where to start
