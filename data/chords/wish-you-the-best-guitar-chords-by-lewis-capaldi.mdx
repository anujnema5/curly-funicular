### **Verse 1**

**(Eb)** I miss knowing what you're thinking **(Bbsus4)** \
**(Bb)** And hearing how your day has **(Cm7)** been \
**(Bbsus4)** Do you think you could **(Bb)** tell me everything, **(Ab5)** darling? \
**(Eb)** But leave out **(Bb)**every part about **(Eb)** him

**(Eb)** Right now, you're probably by the **(Bbsus4)** ocean **(Bb5)** \
**(Bb)** While I'm still out here in the **(Cm7)** rain \
**(Bb)** With every day that passes by since we've **(Ab)** spoken \
**(Bb)** It's like Glasgow gets farther from **(Cm7)** LA

### **Pre Chorus**

**(Bb)** Maybe it's supposed to be this **(Ab)** way

### **Chorus**

**(Ab)** But, oh, my **(Eb)** love \
**(Eb)** I wanna say, "I miss the green in your **(Bb5)** eyes" \
**(Bb5)** And when I said **(Bb)** we could be friends, guess **(Cm7)** I lied \
**(Bb)** I wanna say, "I wish that you never **(Ab)** left" \
**(Ab)** Oh, but instead, I only wish you the **(Eb)** best \
**(Eb)** I wanna say, "Without you, everything's **(Bb)** wrong" \
**(Bb)** And you were everything I need all **(Cm7)** along \
**(Bb)** I wanna say, "I wish that you never **(Ab)** left" \
**(Abm)** Oh, but instead, I only wish you the **(Eb)** best

### **Verse 2**

**(Eb)** Well, I can't help but **(Bbsus4)** notice \
**(Bb)** You seem happier than ever **(Cm7)** now \
**(Bb)** And I guess that I should tell you **(Absus2)** I'm sorry \
**(Ab)** It seems I was the **(Bb)** problem some **(Cm7)** how

### **Pre Chorus**

**(Bb)** Maybe I only brought you **(Ab)** down

### **Chorus**

**(Ab)** But, oh, my **(Eb)** love \
**(Eb)** I wanna say, "I miss the green in your **(Bb)** eyes" \
**(Bb)** And when I said we could be friends, guess I **(Cm7)** lied \
**(Bb)** I wanna say, "I wish that you never **(Ab)** left" \
**(Ab)** Oh, but instead, I only wish you the **(Eb)** best \
**(Eb)** I wanna say, "Without you, everything's **(Bb)** wrong" \
**(Bb)** And you were everything I need all **(Cm7)** along \
**(Bb)** I wanna say, "I wish that you never **(Ab)** left" \
**(Abm)** Oh, but instead, I only wish you the **(Eb)** best

### **Bridge**

**(Abm)** But, oh, my **(Eb)** love \
**(Bb5)** Oh, **(Bb)** Woah \
**(Bb)** Oh, my **(Cm)** love \
**(Bb)** Oh, **(Ab)** woah

### **Chorus**

**(Eb)** Wish I could say it's something I really mean \
**(Bb)** But I want you happy whether or not it's with **(Cm7)** me \
**(Bb)** I wanna say, "I wish that you never **(Ab)** left" \
**(Ab)** Oh, but instead, I only wish you the best \
**(Eb)** I wanna say, "Without you, everything's **(Bb)** wrong" \
**(Bb)** And you were everything I need all **(Cm7)** along \
**(Bb)** I wanna say, "I wish that you never **(Ab)** left" \
**(Ab)** Oh, but instead, **(Abm)** I only wish you the best
