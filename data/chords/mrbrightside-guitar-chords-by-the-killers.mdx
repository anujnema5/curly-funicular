**(C)** Comin' out of my **(C/B)** cage\
and I've been doin' just **(F)** fine\
Gotta, gotta be down\
because I want it all\
**(C)** It started out with a **(C/B)** kiss,\
how did it end up like **(F)** this?\
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss\
**(C)** Now I'm fallin' **(C/B)**asleep\
and she's calling a **(F)** cab\
While he's having a smoke\
and she's takin' a drag\
**(C)** Now they're goin' to **(C/B)** bed,\
and my stomach is **(F)** sick\
And it's all in my head,\
but she's touching his

### Pre-Chorus

**(Am)** Chest now, he takes off her **(G)** dress now\
Let me **(F)** go\
And **(Am)** I just can't look, it's **(G)** killing me\
They're **(F)** taking control

**(C)** Jealousy,\
**(F)** turning saints **(Am)** into the sea\
**(G)** Swimming through sick **(C)** lullabies,\
**(F)** choking on your **(Am)** alibis\
**(G)** But it's just the **(C)** price I pay,\
**(F)** Destiny is **(Am)** calling me\
**(G)** Open up my **(C)** eager **(Fmaj7)** eyes,\
**(Am)** 'cause I'm Mr. **(G)** Brightside
