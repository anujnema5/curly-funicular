**(Bb)** It all began when I was fourteen\
**(Bb)** How bad I wanted this to be\
**(Eb)** Rode a wave of many emotions\

### **Verse 2**

**(Bb)** People here have short memories\
**(Ab)** Sometimes you've gotta knock that door down\
**(Gm)** Gotta work to be that flavour\
**(Gb)** To climb from right down\
**(Gb)** To the **(Eb)** top of the line, top of the **(Gb)** line, top of the **(Bb)** line\
**(Bb)** Oh, to the **(Eb)** top of the **(Gb)** line, the top of the **(Ab)** line, **(Bb)** the top of the line

### **Verse 3**

**(Bb)** No, I won't back down or be in the **(Fm)** crowd\
**(Fm)** See, I was **(Eb)** born to make a difference\
**(Eb)** And that's what **(Db)** I'm gonna do\
**(Db)** I won't back **(Bb)** down\
**(Bb)** Stand apart from the **(Fm)** crowd\
**(Eb)** My life may take me 'round\
**(Gb)** In many circles, **(Ab)** but I\
**(Ab)** I won't back **(Bb5)** down

### **Verse 4**

**(Bb)** There's so little I have **(Ab)** control of\
**(Gm)** I know I gotta pay the **(Gb)** bills\
**(Bb)** I know I've gotta build a **(Ab)** future\
**(Gm7)** So I have time to live and time to breathe\
**(Gb)** And time to see and time to **(Ab)** feel all over **(Bb)** again

### **Chorus**

**(Bb)** No, I won't back down or be in the **(Fm7)** crowd\
**(Fm7)** See, I was **(Eb)** born to make a difference\
**(Db)** And that's what I'm gonna do\
**(Db)** I won't back **(Bb)** down\
**(Bb)** Be apart from the **(Fm)** crowd\
**(Eb)** My life may take me 'round\
**(Gb)** In many circles, **(Ab)** but I

### **Verse 6**

**(Bb)** I'm glad I always knew right from **(Bbm)** wrong\
**(Bbm)** So blessed **(Gbmaj7)** that I can **(Gb)** enter **(Ebm)** tain **(F)**\
**(Bbm)** No matter how hard you try to bring me **(Gbmaj7)** down\
**(Gbmaj7)** I will rise **(Gb)** up\
**(Ebm)** I won't back down **(Fm)**\
**(F5)** I will rise **(F)** up\
**(Gbmaj7)** Oh no, **(Ab)** no, no, no, no **(Bb5)** **(Bbsus4)**

**(Bb)** I won't back down\
**(Bb)** Stay **(Fm)** apart from the crowd\
**(Fm)** See, I was **(Eb)** born to make a difference\
**(Eb)** And that's what **(Db)** I'm gonna do\
**(Db)** I won't back **(Bb)** down\
**(Bb)** Or be **(Fm)** apart from the crowd\
**(Eb)** My life may take me 'round\
**(Gb)** In many circles, but I

### **Verse 8**

**(Bb)** I know you bring me down\
**(Bb)** But I'll rise **(Fm)** up\
**(Fm)** You know, know, know, know, know\
