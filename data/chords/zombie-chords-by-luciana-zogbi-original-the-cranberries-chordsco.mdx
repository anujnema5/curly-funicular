**(D)** With their tanks, **(Em)**and their bombs, and their **(Cm)** bombs, **(C)**and their guns\
In your **(G)** head, in your head they are **(D)** crying\
What's in your **(Em)**head? In your **(C)** head?\

In your **(G)**head, in your head they are **(D)**dying\
In your **(Em)** head, in your **(C)**head\
