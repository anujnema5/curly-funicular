### **Intro**

One, two, one, two, three, four **(C)** **(F)** **(3x)**

### Verse 1

We must **(C)** talk in every telephone, get **(F)** eaten off the **(C)** web\
We must rip out all the epilogues from the **(F)** books that we have **(G)** read\
Into the **(C)** face of every criminal strapped **(F)** firmly to a chair\
We must **(C)** stare, we must **(G)** stare, we must **(C)** stare

### Verse 2

We must **(C)** take all of the medicines too **(F)** expensive now to **(C)** sell\
Set fire to the preacher who is **(F)** promising us **(G)** Hell\
Into the **(C)** ear of every anarchist that **(F)** sleeps but doesn't dream\
We must **(C)** sing, we must **(G)** sing, we must **(C)** sing\
**(And it'll go like this, all right...)**

### Chorus

**(F)** While my mother **(G)** waters plants, my **(C)** father loads his **(F)** gun\
He says, "Death will give us **(G)** back to God\
Just **(Am)** like the setting **(F)** sun\
Is **(G7)** returned to the lonesome ocean" **(C)**

### Post-Chorus

**(C)** And then they splashed into the deep blue sea! **(F)** **(C)**\
Oh, **(F)** it was a **(G)** wonderful splash! **(C)**

### Verse 3

We must **(C)** blend into the choir, sing as **(F)** static with the **(C)** whole\
We must memorize nine numbers and **(F)** deny we have a **(G)** soul\
And in this **(C)** endless race for property and **(F)** privilege to be won\
We must **(C)** run, we must **(G)** run, we must **(C)** run

### Verse 4

We must **(C)** hang up in the belfry where the **(F)** bats and moonlight **(C)** laugh\
We must stare into a crystal ball and only **(F)** see the **(C)** past\
Into the **(C)** caverns of tomorrow with just our **(F)** flashlights and our love\
We must **(C)** plunge, we must **(G)** plunge, we must **(C)** plunge

### Chorus

**(F)** Oh, my morning's **(C)** coming back, **(C)** the whole world's waking **(F)** up\
All the city buses **(G)** swimming past, I'm **(Am)** happy just be **(F)** cause\
I **(G)** found out I am really no **(C)** one
