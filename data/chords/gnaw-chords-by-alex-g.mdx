**(Am)** **(Em7)** **(Em)** **(C)** **(G)** **(Am)** **(Am7)** **(Em7)** \

**(Am)** **(Am7)** **(Em7)** **(Em)** **(C)** **(G)** **(F)**

**(Am)** Yeah, you were scarred **(Em7)**\
**(Em)** And you **(C)** were cryin' loud, right **(G)** out in the schoolyard\
**(Am7)** And, yeah, I felt **(Em7)** good\
**(C)** Everything I knew was looking **(G)** just as it should\
**(Am7)** I saw the **(Em)** tree\
**(C)** Carved in it "66 **(G)** 6" and he found me\
**(Am7)** But I am no **(Em7)** fool\
**(C)** I know every time I look in **(G)** his eyes, he sees me too **(F)**

**(G)** Dry your **(Em)** eyes\
I won't tell your **(D)** mother\
She won't ever **(C)** discover\
The things you kept under the **(G)** covers\
And please don't **(Em)** cry\
I am not your **(Bm)** brother\
I am not your **(C)** lover\
And there is nothing **(G)** wrong
