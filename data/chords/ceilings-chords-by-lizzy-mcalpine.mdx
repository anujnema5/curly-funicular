### Verse 1

**(Dsus2)** Ceilings, **(F#m7)** plaster\
**(Dsus2)** Can't you just make it **(A)** move **(E)** faster?\
**(Dsus2)** Lovely **(F#m7)** to be sitting here **(E)** with you\
**(E)** You're kinda cute but it's **(Dsus2)** raining **(F#m7)** harder\
**(Dsus2)** My shoes are now **(A)** full of **(E)** water\
**(Dsus2)** Lovely to **(F#m7)** be rained on **(E)** with you\
**(E)** It's kinda cute but it's **(Dsus2)** so short

### Chorus

**(Dsus2)** Then you're driving me **(A)** home\
**(A)** And I don't wanna **(E)** leave\
**(E)** But I have to go\
**(Dsus2)** You kiss me in your car\
**(A)** And it feels like the start of a **(E)** movie I've seen **(F#m7)** before\
**(E)** Before

### Verse 2

**(Dsus2)** Bed sheets, **(F#m7)** no clothes\
**(Dsus2)** Touch me like **(A)** nobody **(E)** else does\
**(Dsus2)** Lovely **(F#m7)** to just lay here **(E)** with you\
**(E)** You're kinda cute and I **(Dsus2)** would say **(F#m7)** all of this\
**(Dsus2)** But I don't wanna **(A)** ruin the **(E)** moment\
**(Dsus2)** Lovely to **(C#7)**/**(F)** sit between **(C#7)** comfort **(Dsus2)** and chaos **(E)**

### Chorus

**(Dsus2)** But it's over\
**(Dsus2)** Then you're driving me **(A)** home\
**(A)** And it kinda comes **(E)** out as I get up to **(Dsus2)** go\
**(Dsus2)** You kiss me in your car\
**(A)** And it feels like the start of a **(E)** movie I've seen before

### Outro

**(Dsus2)** But it's not real\
**(Dsus2)**  And you don't **(A)**  exist\
**(A)** And I can't **(E)** recall the last time I was **(Dsus2)** kissed\
**(Dsus2)** It hits me in the car\
**(A)** And it feels like the end of a **(E)** movie I've seen **(F#m7)** before\
**(E)** Before
