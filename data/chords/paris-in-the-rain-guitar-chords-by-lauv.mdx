### Verse

**(Em7)** All I know is [ooh ooh ooh]\
**(A)** We could go anywhere we could do\

**(Em7)** All I know is [ooh ooh ooh]\
**(A)** Getting lost late at night under stars\

**(A)** You and I alone and\
**(D)** People may be **(Bm)** watching I don't mind 'cause

### Chorus

**(Em7)** Anywhere with you feels right\
**(A)** Anywhere with you feels like\
**(D)** Paris in the rain\
**(Bm)** Paris in the rain\
**(Em7)** We don't need a fancy town\
**(A)** Or bottles that we can't pronounce\

**(Bm)** Paris in the rain

### Verse

**(Em7)** I look at you now and I want this forever\
I might not deserve it\
but there's nothing better\
**(D)** Don't know how I ever\
did it all without you\
**(Bm)** My heart is about to\
about to jump out of my chest\
**(Em7)** Feelings they come and they go that they do\
**(A)** Feelings they come and they go not with **(D)** you\
The late nights\
**(C#m)** And the street lights\
And the people\
**(Bm)** Look at me girl\
And the whole world could stop

### Chorus

**(Em7)** Anywhere with you feels right\
**(A)** Anywhere with you feels like\
**(D)** Paris in the rain\
**(Bm)** Paris in the rain\
**(Em7)** We don't need a fancy town\
**(A)** Or bottles that we can't pronounce\
**(D)** Cause anywhere babe\
**(Bm)** Is like Paris in the rain\
**(Em7)** When I'm with you\
**(A)** When I'm with you\
**(D)** Paris in the rain\
**(Bm)** Paris in the rain

**(D)** Girl when I'm not with you\
**(Bm)** All I do is miss you\
**(Em7)** **(A)**\
**(D)** Come and set the mood right\
**(Bm)** Underneath the moonlight\
**(Em7)** [Days in Paris\
**(A)** Nights in Paris]\
**(D)** Paint you with my eyes closed\
**(Bm)** Wonder where the time goes\
**(Em7)** [Yeah, **(A)** Isn't it obvious\
Isn't it obvious]\
**(D)** Come and set the mood right\
**(Bm)** Underneath the moonlight

**(Gm)** Puddles underneath our **(A)** feet
