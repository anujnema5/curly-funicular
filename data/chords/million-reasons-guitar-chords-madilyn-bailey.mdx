### \[Verse 1\]

You're **(C)** givin’ me a million reasons to let you go\
You're **(Am7)** givin' me a million reasons to quit the show\
You’re **(F)** givin' me a million reasons, givin' me a million reasons\
**(G)** Givin' me a million reasons, about a million\
If I **(C)** had a highway, I'd run for the hills\
If **(Am7)** you could found a dry way, I'd forever be still\
But you're **(F)** givin' me a million reasons, givin’ me a million reasons\
**(G)** Givin’ me a million reasons, about a million

### \[Chorus\]

And **(F)** I bow **(C)** down to **(Am7)** pray, trying to make the **(G)** worst seem better\
**(F)** Lord, show **(C)** me the **(Am7)** way to cut through all his **(G)** worn-out leather\
**(F)** I've got a **(C)** hundred million **(Am7)** reasons to walk away **(G)**\
**(F)** All I need is one good one to stay

### \[Verse 2\]

**(C)** Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare\
It’s **(Am7)** like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware\
Cause you're **(F)** givin’ me a million reasons, givin' me a million reasons\
**(G)** Givin' me a million reasons, about a million\
**(C)** And if you say something that you might even mean\
It's **(Am7)** hard to even fathom which parts I should believe\
'Cause you've **(F)** givin' me a million reasons, givin' me a million reasons\
**(G)** Givin' me a million reasons, about a million

### \[Chorus\]

And **(F)** I bow **(C)** down to **(Am7)** pray, trying to make the **(G)** worst seem better\
**(F)** Lord, show **(C)** me the **(Am7)** way to cut through all his **(G)** worn-out leather\
**(F)** I've got a **(C)** hundred million **(Am7)** reasons to walk away **(G)**\
**(F)** All I need is one good one to stay

### \[Bridge\]

**(C)** Oh, baby, I'm **(G)** bleedin', I'm bleedin', **(Am7)** eh-eh **(F)**\
**(C)** Can't you give me what I'm **(G)** needin', needin'?\
**(F)** Every heart **(C)** break makes it **(G)** hard to keep the **(Am)** faith\
But **(F)** baby, I just need one good one, good one\
**(F)** Baby, I just need one good one

### \[Chorus\]

And **(F)** I bow **(C)** down to **(Am7)** pray, trying to make the **(G)** worst seem better\
**(F)** Lord, show **(C)** me the **(Am7)** way to cut through all his **(G)** worn-out leather\
**(F)** I've got a **(C)** hundred million **(Am)** reasons to walk away **(G)**\
I just **(F)** need is one good one, good one\
Tell me **(F)** that you'll be the good one, good one\
Baby, I'll **(F)** just need one good one to stay **(Am)** **(F)** **(C)**
