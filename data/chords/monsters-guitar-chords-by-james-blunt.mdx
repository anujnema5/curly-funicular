Intro

**(C)** **(C/B)** **(Am)** **(Am7/G)** **(F)**

### Verse 1

**(C)**Oh, before they turn **(C/B)**off all the **(Am)**lights\
I won't read you your **(Am7/G)**wrongs or your **(F)**rights\
The time has **(C)**gone\
I'll tell you **(C/B)**goodnight, close the **(Am)**door\
Tell you I **(Am7/G)**love you once **(F)**more\
The time has **(C)**gone\
So here it **(G)**is

### Chorus

I'm not your **(F)**son, you're not my **(G)**father\
We're just **(C)**two grown men **(Cmaj9/B)**saying **(Am)**goodbye\
No **(F)**need to forgive, no **(G)**need to forget\
I know **(C)**your mistakes **(Cmaj9/B)**and you know **(Am)**mine\
**(F)** And while you're sleeping,\
I'll **(G)**try to make you proud\
So **(C)**daddy, won't you **(Cmaj9/B)**just close your **(Am)**eyes?\
Don't be **(F)**afraid, it's my **(G)**turn\
To chase the monsters **(C)**away

### Verse 2

**(C)**Oh, well I'll read a **(C/B)**story to **(Am)**you\
Only difference is **(Am7/G)**this one is **(F)**true\
The time has **(C)**gone\
I folded your **(C/B)**clothes on the **(Am)**chair\
I hope you sleep **(Am7/G)**well, don't be **(F)**scared\
The time has **(C)**gone\
So here it **(G)**is

### Chorus

I'm not your **(F)**son, you're not my **(G)**father\
We're just **(C)**two grown men **(Cmaj9/B)**saying **(Am)**goodbye\
No **(F)**need to forgive, no **(G)**need to forget\
I know **(C)**your mistakes **(Cmaj9/B)**and you know **(Am)**mine\
**(F)** And while you're sleeping,\
I'll **(G)**try to make you proud\
So **(C)**daddy, won't you **(Cmaj9/B)**just close your **(Am)**eyes?\
Don't be **(F)**afraid, it's my **(G)**turn\
To chase the monsters away

### Bridge

**(C)**Sleep a **(Cmaj9/B)**lifetime\
Yes, and **(Am)**breathe a **(Am7/G)**last word\
You can **(F)**feel my **(C6/E)**hand on your **(Gsus4/D)**own **(G)**\
I will **(C)**be the **(Cmaj9/B)**last one, so I'll **(Am)**leave a **(Am7/G)**light on\
Let there **(F)**be no **(C6/E)**darkness in your **(Gsus4/D)**heart **(G)**

### Outro

I'm not your **(F)**son, you're not my **(G)**father\
We're just **(C)**two grown men **(Cmaj9/B)**saying **(Am)**goodbye\
No **(F)**need to forgive, no **(G)**need to forget\
I know **(C)**your mistakes **(Cmaj9/B)**and you know **(Am)**mine\
**(F)** And while you're sleeping,\
I'll **(G)**try to make you proud\
So **(C)**daddy, won't you **(Cmaj9/B)**just close your **(Am)**eyes?\
Don't be **(F)**afraid, it's my **(G)**turn\
To chase the monsters **(C)**away
