**(Cm)** Someone said your name, I had to turn **(Bb)** around \
**(Gm)** Suddenly you're there standing in the **(Ab)** crowd \
**(Cm)** Everything comes back in the **(Bb)** blink of an eye

It's like you're **(Gm)** mine, **(Eb)** you're still **(Ab)** mine **(Cm)** \
We skip the small talk, **(Bb)**'cause you know me

**(Eb)** Better than I, know **(Ab)** myself \
**(Cm)** Oh my, it's been a while now, **(Bb)** since I saw you \
**(Eb)** But it feels like, **(Ab)** yesterday

**(Cm)** Somеhow time has **(Bb)** stopped \
**(Eb)** Nothing's changed, **(Ab)** wе're the same \
**(Cm)** And we skip the small talk, **(Bb)** cause you know me \
