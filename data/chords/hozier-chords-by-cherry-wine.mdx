### Verse 1

**(G)** Her eyes and words are so icy \
**(G)** Oh, but she **(Em)** burns \
**(Em)** Like **(C)** rum on a **(G)** fire \
**(G)** Hot and fast and angry as she can be \
**(Em)** I walk my **(C)** days on a **(G)** wire

### Pre Chorus

**(C)** It looks **(Em)** ugly, **(C)** but it's **(Em)** clean \
**(C)** Oh **(Em)** ma- **(Am)** ma, don't **(D)** fuss over **(G)** me

### Chorus

**(G)** The way she tells me I'm hers and she is mine \
**(G)** Open hand or closed fist, oh, would be fine \
**(C)** The blood is rare and as **(Am)** sweet **(C)** as cherry **(G)** wine

### Verse 2

**(G)** Calls of guilty thrown at me, all while she **(Em)** stains \
**(C)** The sheets of some **(G)** other \
**(G)** Thrown at me so powerfully, just like she **(Em)** throws \
**(C)** With the arm of her **(G)** brother

### Pre Chorus

**(C)** But I **(Em)** want it, **(C)** it's a **(Em)** crime \
**(C)** That she's not **(Am)** around **(D)** most of the **(G)** time

### Chorus

**(G)** The way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine \
**(G)** Open hand or closed fist, oh, would be fine \
**(G)** The blood is **(Am)** rare and as sweet as **(C)** cherry **(G)** wine

### Verse 3

**(G)** Her fight and fury's fiery \
**(Bm)** Oh, but **(G)** she **(Em)** loves \
**(Em)** Like **(G)** sleep to the freezing \
**(G)** Sweet and right and merciful, I'm all but **(Em)** washed \
**(Em)** In the **(C)** tide of her **(G)** breathing

### Pre Chorus

**(C)** And it's **(Em)** worth it, **(C)** it's **(Em)** divine \
**(C)** I have this some of the **(G)** time

### Chorus

**(G)** The way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine \
**(G)** Open hand or closed fist, oh, would be fine \
**(C)** The blood is **(Cm)** rare **(C)** and as **(Am)** sweet as **(C)** cherry **(G)** wine
