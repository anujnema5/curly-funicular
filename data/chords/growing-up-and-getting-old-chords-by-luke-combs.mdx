### Verse 1

**(D)** I still hit them dive bars, **(D)** every **(G)** once in a blue **(D)** moon\
**(D)** I've got a wild card, that I **(G)** keep inside my **(D)** boot\
**(D)** I've been **(A)** thinkin' lately **(G)** maybe I should **(D)** save it\
**(D)** 'Cause them **(A)** hangovers sure **(G)** kick my ass these **(D)** days\
**(D)** So I spend most **(Bm)** my happy **(A)** hours here at **(G)** home\
**(G)** In the middle of **(A)** growin' up and gettin' **(D)** old

### Chorus

**(D)** But I can still raise hell all night with the boys when I **(G)** want to\
**(D)** Lay that hammer down to see how fast she'll **(A)** go\
**(A)** But these **(D)** days I hang my hat on what I **(G)** won't do\
**(D)** I've been findin' peace of mind slowin' my **(A)** roll\
**(A)** You learn to **(Bm)** toe that **(A)** line with time as it **(G)** goes\
**(G)** In the middlе of growin' **(A)** up and gettin' **(D)** old

### Verse 2

**(D)** It's when you start thinkin', how much **(G)** time lеft you **(D)** got\
**(D)** If it's more sand, in the bottom **(G)** or the **(D)** top\
**(D)** Cause that **(A)** hourglass we **(G)** have don't last **(D)** forever\
**(D)** I've been **(A)** thinkin' 'bout it **(G)** more and more these **(D)** days\
**(D)** It's like the less you have, the **(Bm)** faster that it **(G)** goes\
**(G)** In the middle of **(A)** growin' up and gettin' **(D)** old

### Chorus

**(D)** But I can still raise hell all night with the boys when I **(G)** want to\
**(D)** Lay that hammer down to see how fast she'll **(A)** go\
**(A)** But these **(D)** days I hang my hat on what I **(G)** won't do\
**(D)** I've been findin' peace of mind slowin' my **(A)** roll\
**(A)** You learn to **(Bm)** toe that **(A)** line with time as it **(G)** goes\
**(G)** In the middlе of growin' **(A)** up and gettin' **(D)** old

### Bridge

**(D)** I'm still **(A)** bendin' rules but **(G)** thinkin' 'fore I **(D)** break 'em\
**(D)** And I ain't lost a **(G)** step, I just look **(D)** before I **(A)** take 'em

### Chorus

**(A)** But I can **(D)** still raise hell all night with the boys when I **(G)** want to\
**(D)** Lay that hammer down to see how fast she'll **(A)** go\
**(A)** But these **(D)** days I hang my hat on what I **(G)** won't do\
**(D)** I've been findin' peace of mind slowin' my **(A)** roll\
**(A)** You learn to **(Bm)** toe that **(A)** line with time as it **(G)** goes\
**(G)** In the middlе of growin' **(A)** up and gettin' **(D)** old
