### Verse 1

**(Db)** How is this supposed to feel\
**(Db)** Hanging round these streets **(Gb)** again?\
**(Gb)** Close to someone else's chest\
**(Gb)** Wanted it all but **(Ab)** couldn't feel less\
**(Db)** You swirled around my room\
**(Db)** Like an everlasting **(Gb)** ghost\
**(Gb)** He's right here but I'm alone\
**(Gb)** Morning breaks, **(Db)** I'm still in my clothes

### Verse 2

**(Bbm)** No, I don't\
**(Ab)** Care about moving on, care about being **(Db)** alone\
**(Gb)** When everybody says I should let go **(Ab)**\
**(Bbm)** I should\
**(Bbm)** That way it's **(Ab)** all a lie, that way you're still mine\
**(Gb)** I'd do it again but I can't\
**(Gb)** I want it, I'm done but **(Ab)** I can't

### Chorus

**(Ab)** So, **(Db)** how is it supposed to **(Ab)** feel?\
**(Ab)** Cause I don't feel a **(Gb)** thing\
**(Gb)** Other than the emptiness since **(Ab)** you left\
**(Db)** So how is it supposed to **(Ab)** feel?\
**(Ab)** Cause I don't want a **(Gb)** thing\
**(Gb)** Other than the **(Ab)** sound of your **(Db)** heartbeat next to mine

### Verse 3

**(Db)** When am I supposed to be\
**(Ab)** Starting all over again?\
**(Gb)** Teaching one to understand my bits and **(Ab)** pieces\
**(Ab)** How they all fit\
**(Db)** You've won my sanity **(Ab)** and all this insanity\
**(Gb)** And I want to hold on but I can't\
**(Gb)** I try to let go but I can't

### Chorus

**(Ab)** So, **(Db)** how is it supposed to **(Ab)** feel?\
**(Ab)** Cause I don't feel a **(Gb)** thing\
**(Gb)** Other than the emptiness since **(Ab)** you left\
**(Db)** So how is it supposed to **(Ab)** feel?\
**(Ab)** Cause I don't want a **(Gb)** thing\
**(Gb)** Other than the **(Ab)** sound of your **(Db)** heartbeat next to mine\
**(Db)** Mmm
