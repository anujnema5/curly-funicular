**Intro** - **(D)** **(G)** **(D)** **(G)**

### Verse

**(D)** I know that it is freezing but I think we have to walk **(G)** **(D)**\
Keep waving at the taxis, they keep turning their lights off **(G)** **(Gmaj7)**\
But **(Em)** Julie knows a party at some actor's **(Am)** west-side **(A)** loft\
Supplies are **(Em)** endless in the evening, by the morning, they' **(A)** ll be gone **(D)**\
When everything is lonely, I can be my own best friend **(G)**\
I get a **(D)** coffee and the paper, have my own conversations **(G)** **(Gmaj7)**\
With the **(Em)** sidewalk and the pigeons and my window **(E)** reflec **(A)** tion\
The mask I **(Em)** polish in the **(G)** evening, by the morning **(A)** looks like **(D)** shit

### Chorus

And I **(G)** know you have a heavy heart, I can **(D)** feel it when we kiss\
So **(G)** many men stronger than me have thrown their **(D)** backs out, trying to lift **(E7)** it\
But **(G)** me, I'm not a **(Bm)** gamble, you can **(D)** count on **(A)** me to **(G)** split\
The love I **(Em)** sell you in the **(Gm)** evening, by the **(Em)** morning, **(A)** won't exist **(D)**

### Verse

**(D)** You're looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted black **(G)**\
Just keep **(D)** going to the bathroom always say you'll be right back **(G)**\
Well it takes **(Em)** one to know one kid, I think you've got it **(G)** bad **(A)**\
But what's so **(Em)** easy in the **(Gm)** evening, by the morning's **(A)** such a **(D)** drag\
I've got a flask inside my pocket, we can share it on the train **(G)**\
And if you **(D)** promise to stay conscious, I will try and do the same **(G)**\
Yeah we might **(Em)** die from medication but we **(G)** sure killed all the pain **(A)**\
What was **(Em)** normal in the **(Gm)** evening, by the **(Em)** morning, **(A)** seems **(D)** insane

### Chorus

And I'm **(G)** not sure what the trouble was, that **(D)** started all of this\
The re **(G)** asons all have run away, but the fe **(D)** eling n **(E7)** ever did\
It's **(G)** not something I would **(Bm)** recommend but it **(D)** is one **(A)** way to live **(G)**\
'Cause what is **(Em)**simple in the moonlight, by the morning, **(A)** never **(D)** is\
Yeah it was simple **(E)** in the **(G)** moonlight, now it's so compl **(A)** icated **(Bm)**\
It was so s **(Em)** imple in the moonlight, so simple in the moonlight, **(Gm)** so **(Em)** simple in the **(G)** moonlight **(D)**
