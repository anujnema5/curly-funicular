**(C)** You were **(Em)** on the West side, I was drivin' down the I-10\
**(C)** And the **(Em)** song came on, got me thinkin' who you chose instead **(C)**\
**(C)** No, I **(Em)** never thought twice, but I wonder what you see in them **(C)**\
**(C)** Another **(Em)** day goes by, that I can't get you outta my head
