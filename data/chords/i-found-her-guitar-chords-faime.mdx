### Chorus

**(A)** I found love in the loneliest\
City on **(Dmaj7)** earth\
Where **(F#m)** people hurt people so they\
Don’t feel hurt **(D)**\
I found **(E)** her\
In the loneliest city on earth

### Verse

**(A)** I remember winter **(D)** nights\
**(F#m)** Being wrapped up in your **(D)** eyes\
**(A)** Yeah, the way we watched the **(Dmaj7)** world go by\
**(F#m)** Wish I could have changed your **(D)** mind

### Chorus

I found **(A)** love in the loneliest\
City on **(Dmaj7)** earth\
Where **(F#m)** people hurt people so they\
Don’t feel hurt **(Dmaj7)**\
Lost my **(A)** soul to the city when she\
Said goodbye **(Dmaj7)**\
Oh, it **(F#m)** hurts to know our timing\
Wasn’t **(D)** right\
She **(F#m)** was the only one, one\
Of a **(D)** kind\
I found **(E)** her\
In the loneliest city on **(A)** earth

### Verse

**(A)** In silence **(Dmaj7)** love\
Our distance grows **(F#m)**
Goodbyes don’t **(D)** hit the same way any **(A)** more\
And heaven **(Dmaj7)** knows\
How two let **(F#m)** go\
But this city never felt **(D)** like home

### Chorus

I found **(A)** love in the loneliest\
City on **(Dmaj7)** earth\
Where **(F#m)** people hurt people so they\
Don’t feel hurt **(Dmaj7)**\
Lost my **(A)** soul to the city when she\
Said goodbye **(Dmaj7)**\
Oh, it **(F#m)** hurts to know our timing\
Wasn’t **(D)** right\
She **(F#m)** was the only one, one\
Of a **(D)** kind\
I found **(E)** herIn the loneliest city on **(A)** earth
