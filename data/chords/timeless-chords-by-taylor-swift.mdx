### Intro

**(C)** **(Gsus4)** **(Am)** **(Gsus4)** **(F)**

### [Verse 1]

**(C)** Down the block, there's an antique shop\
And **(Gsus4)** something in my head said, "Stop, " so I walked in\
**(Am)** On the counter was a **(Gsus4)** cardboard box\
And the **(F)** sign said, "Photos: twenty-five cents each"

**(C)** Black and white, saw a '30s bride\
And **(Gsus4)** two lovers laughin' on the porch of their first house\
**(Am)** The kinda love that you **(Gsus4)** only find once in a **(F)** lifetime\
The kind you don't put down\
**(Gsus4)** And that's when I **(Am)** called you and it's **(F)** so hard to explain, but\
**(Gsus4)** In those photos, **(Am)** I saw us **(F)** instead\
**(Gsus4)** And, somehow, I **(Am)** know that you and **(F)** I would've found each other\
**(Gsus4)** In another life, you **(Am)** still would've turned my **(F)** head even **(Gsus4)** if we'd met

### [Chorus]

On a **(C)** crowded street in 1944\
**(Gsus4)** And you were headed off to fight in the war\
**(Am)** You still would've been **(Gsus4)** mine\
We would have been **(F)** timeless\
I would've **(C)** read your love letters every single night\
**(Gsus4)** And prayed to God you'd be comin' home all right\
**(Am)** And you would've been **(Gsus4)** fine\
We would have been **(F)** timeless\
'Cause **(C)** I believe that **(Gsus4)** we were supposed to **(F)** find this\
So, even in a different **(Am)** life, you still would've been **(F)** mine\
We would've been **(C)** timeless

### [Verse 2]

**(C)** I had to smile when it caught my eye\
There was **(Gsus4)** one of a teenage couple in the driveway\
**(Am)** Holdin' hands on the **(Gsus4)** way to a dance\
And the **(F)** date on the back said 1958

**(C)** Which brought me back to the first time I saw you\
**(Gsus4)** Time stood still like somethin' in this old shop\
**(Am)** I thought about it as I **(Gsus4)** started lookin' 'round\
At these **(F)** precious things that time forgot

**(Gsus4)** That's when I **(Am)** came upon a book **(F)** covered in cobwebs\
**(Gsus4)** Story of a romance **(Am)** torn apart by **(F)** fate\
**(Gsus4)** Hundreds of **(Am)** years ago, they **(F)** fell in love, like we did\
**(Gsus4)** And I'd die for **(Am)** you in the same **(F)** way if I first **(Gsus4)** saw your face

### [Chorus]

In the **(C)** fifteen hundreds off in a foreign land\
**(Gsus4)** And I was forced to marry another man\
**(Am)** You still would've been **(Gsus4)** mine\
We would have been **(F)** timeless\
I would've **(C)** read your love letters every single night\
**(Gsus4)** And run away and left it all behind\
**(Am)** You still would've been **(Gsus4)** mine\
We would've been **(F)** timeless

### [Bridge]

**(Gsus4)** Time breaks **(Am)** down your **(F)** mind and body\
**(Gsus4)** Don't you **(Am)** let it touch your **(F)** soul\
It was like an **(Gsus4)** age-old **(Am)** classic\
The **(F)** first time that you saw me\
The **(Gsus4)** story started **(Am)** when you said, **(F)** "Hello"

### [Chorus]

In a **(C)** crowded room a few short years ago\
**(Gsus4)** And sometimes there's no proof, you just know\
**(Am)** You're always gonna be **(Gsus4)** mine\
We're gonna be **(F)** timeless\
I'm gonna **(C)** love you when our hair is turnin' gray\
We'll have a **(Gsus4)** cardboard box of photos of the life we've made\
**(Am)** And you'll say, **(Gsus4)** "Oh my, we really were **(F)** timeless"

### [Post-Chorus]

We're gonna be **(C)** timeless, **(Gsus4)** timeless\
**(Am)** You still would've been **(Gsus4)** mine\
We would've been **(F)** even if we'd met on a **(C)** crowded street in 1944 **(Gsus4)**\
**(Am)** You still would've been **(Gsus4)** mine\
We would've been **(F)**

### [Outro]

**(C)** Down the block, there's an antique shop\
And **(Gsus4)** somethin' in my head said, "Stop, " so I walked **(F)** in
