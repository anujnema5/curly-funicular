**(C7)** Oh, you're a **(F)** hard one, **(F7)** but I know that **(A#)** you got your **(A#m)** reasons\

**(Dm)** You know the queen of hearts **(A#)** is always your best **(F)** bet\
**(C)** Now it **(Dm)** seems to me some **(Am)** fine things\

**(F)** Come down from your **(Dm)** fences, **(G7)** open the **(C)** gate\
**(C)** It may be **(F)** rainin', but there's a **(A#)** rainbow above **(A#m)** you\
**(F)** You better let **(C)** somebody **(Dm)** love you **(A#)** (Let somebody **(Gm)** love you)\
