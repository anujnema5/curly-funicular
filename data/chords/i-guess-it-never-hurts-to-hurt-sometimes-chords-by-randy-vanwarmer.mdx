### **Verse 1**

**(Bb)** Sometimes I feel a wave of the **(Eb)** past break in my mind\
**(Bb)** And I know it's gone for good and it **(F)** makes me want to cry\
**(Bb)** Is this all we get to keep as the years **(Eb)** go rolling by\
**(Bb)** Just a memory for **(F)** all the days gone **(Eb)** by **(Db)**

### **Verse 2**

**(Bb)** Oh, you're always in my heart, **(Eb)** you're often on my mind\
**(Bb)** I will never let it die just as **(F)** long as I'm alive\
**(Bb)** And sometimes it makes me sad that we **(Eb)**never said goodbye\
**(Bb)** But I guess it never **(F)** hurts to hurt **(Eb)** sometimes

### **Verse 3**

**(Bb)** You try and hold on to the moment, **(Eb)** but time won't let you stay\
**(Bb)** And for every step you take, you lose **(F)** something on the way\
**(F)** You can't look **(Bb)** forward to tomorrow and **(Bb7)** still hold **(Eb)** on to yesterday\
**(Eb)** I just **(Bb)** hope that you can **(F)** hear me when I **(Eb)** say

### **Verse 4**

**(Bb)** That you're always in my heart, **(Eb)** you're often on my mind\
**(Eb)** I will never **(Bb)** let it die just as **(F)** long as I'm alive\
**(Bb)** And sometimes it makes me sad that we **(Eb)** never said goodbye\
**(Bb)** But I guess it never **(F)** hurts to hurt **(Eb)** sometimes

### **Verse 5**

**(Bb)** Yes, you're always in my heart, **(Eb)** you're often on my mind\
**(Bb)** I will never let it die just as **(F)** long as I'm alive\
**(Bb)** And sometimes it makes me sad that we **(Eb)** never said goodbye\
**(Bb)** But I guess it never hurts to **(F)** hurt sometimes\
**(Bb)** No, I guess it never hurts **(F)** to  hurt **(Eb)** sometimes
