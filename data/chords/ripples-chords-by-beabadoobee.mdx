**Intro** - **(A)** **(F#m)** **(Bm)** **(C#7)** **(F#m)** **(Bm)** **(E)**

### Verse 1

**(A)** Please **(F#m)** don't make me **(Am)** hide, **(G#m)** I've been putting **(C#7)** up a fight\
What's the **(F#m)** use of it **(B)** now? When I **(E7)** get pulled down anyways\
I've been **(A)** hiding my **(F#m)** expression, **(G#m7)** you can't blame the **(C#7)** reflections\
And the **(F#m7)** ripples on the **(B7)** ground, I **(Bm)** might as well have drowned **(E7)**

### Chorus

**(A)** So I'm keeping busy, work **(D)** twice as **(F#m)** hard **(D)** as you\
**(A)** Want you to **(F#m)** believe **(A)** me **(D)** that I can **(F#m)** pick and choose\
**(A)** Said you'd let me drive your **(D)** car as long as I'm with you\
**(A)** Then you'd wait till we get far to **(D)** tell me **(F#m)** that you'll be **(D)** gone soon

### Verse 2

**(F#m)** Feels too late right now, **(G#m)** I've been holding **(C#7)** back\
'Causе I'm **(F#m)** afraid that I'm **(B7)** too loud **(E7)** six feet underground\
I feel **(A)** alone **(F#m)** again, **(G#m7)** stuck between **(C#7)** my friеnds\
I guess I'll **(F#m)** figure my **(B7)** way through them, **(E7)** not sure how I do it\
But I'm **(A)** sure now **(F#m)**, the **(G#m)** people would **(C#7)** listen as the **(F#m)** water **(B7)** glistens\
And I **(Bm7)** see my reflection, **(E)** so much clearer

### Chorus

**(A)** So I'm keeping busy, work **(D)** twice as **(F#m)** hard **(D)** as you\
**(A)** Want you to **(F#m)** believe **(A)** me **(D)** that I can **(F#m)** pick and choose\
**(A)** Said you'd let me drive your **(D)** car as long as I'm with you\
**(A)** Then you'd wait till we get far to **(D)** tell me **(F#m)** that you'll be **(D)** gone soon
