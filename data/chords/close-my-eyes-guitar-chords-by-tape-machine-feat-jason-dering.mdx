### Verse 1

**(C#m)** I left things unsaid, **(E)** and you **(B)** cannot for **(F#m)** get\
How my mistakes haunt us **(E)**\
But do you **(G#)** really daunt us?\
**(C#m)** Your tongue can be sharp, **(E)** cut me **(B)** close to the **(F#m)** heart\
But we can master the art **(E)**\
And the **(G#)** thing is that these **(A)** scars, are scary but they **(B)** are just some old **(E)** scars\
We should **(B)** never be **(C#m)** afraid of them\
**(A)** You & I know when we **(B)** are too far a **(E)** part\
Every **(B)** thing just falls **(C#m)** apart

### Chorus

So I just close my **(A)** eyes\
And **(B)** dream a **(C#m)** bout\
Our kids and **(A)** how they’re **(B)** running **(C#m)** around\
Won’t you come and **(A)** lay **(B)** down **(E)** next to me **(C#m)**\
Close your **(A)** eyes and **(B)** we’ll bе **(E)** free

### Verse 2

**(C#m)** I’ll keep my head high, **(E)** while we’rе **(B)** crossing the **(F#m)** land\
With all the mines we’ve laid down **(E)**\
It’s gonna **(G#)** take us some **(C#m)** time\
But I won’t give **(E)** up, though I **(B)** know it is **(F#m)** tough\
We need to break our patterns **(E)**\
It’s better **(G#)** now than after **(A)** we\
Have drifted off too **(B)** far, let’s tear down these **(E)** walls\
Our **(B)** destiny has **(C#m)** called **(for us **(A)** now)**\
We’re walking down our **(B)** path\
And the wind will change at **(E)** last\
Like a **(B)** song about our **(C#m)** past

### Chorus

**(C#m)** I’ll keep my head high, **(E)** while we’rе **(B)** crossing the **(F#m)** land\
With all the mines we’ve laid down **(E)**\
It’s gonna **(G#)** take us some **(C#m)** time\
But I won’t give **(E)** up, though I **(B)** know it is **(F#m)** tough\
We need to break our patterns **(E)**\
It’s better **(G#)** now than after **(A)** we\
Have drifted off too **(B)** far, let’s tear down these **(E)** walls\
Our **(B)** destiny has **(C#m)** called **(for us **(A)** now)**\
We’re walking down our **(B)** path\
And the wind will change at **(E)** last\
Like a **(B)** song about our **(C#m)** past

### Verse 3

I can’t see the **(A)** point, of pointing fingers\
Come let’s re **(E)** joice of **(B)** what will **(C#m)** come\
I have made the **(A)** choice of thinking bigger\
Cause **(E)** you are all that **(B)** I need, **(C#m)** you are all that I need

### Chorus

So I just close my **(A)** eyes\
And **(B)** dream a **(C#m)** bout\
Our kids and **(A)** how they’re **(B)** running **(C#m)** around\
Won’t you come and **(A)** lay **(B)** down **(E)** next to me **(C#m)**\
Close your **(A)** eyes and **(B)** we’ll bе **(E)** free
