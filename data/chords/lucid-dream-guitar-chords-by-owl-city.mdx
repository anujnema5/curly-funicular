### Intro

**(G)** **(Bm)** **(Asus4)** **(Em)**

### Verse 1

**(G)** I am a light **(Bm)** sleeper\
But **(Asus4)** I am a heavy **(Em)** dreamer\
**(G)** My imagination **(Bm)** gives me wings\
And **(Asus4)** I can go **(Em)** anywhere

### Pre-Chorus

And **(G)** when I wander away\
To some other **(Bm)** place\
I'm suddenly there, way up in the **(Asus4)** air\
Where passenger trains catch fire and **(Em)** fill the sky with flames\
And **(G)** that black rabbit of death\
Wakes up in a **(Bm)** breath of beautiful dreams\
My heartache, it **(Asus4)** seems so terribly vain\
Where fire and **(Em)** diamonds fall like rain

### Chorus

Do you **(G)** believe in endless miracles\
Do you **(Bm)** believe in the impossible\
Do you **(Asus4)** believe\
Sleep is a time **(Em)** machine\
Do you **(G)** believe in curiosity\
Do you **(Bm)** believe in what you cannot see\
Do you **(Asus4)** believe\
Life is a lucid **(Em)** dream

### Post-Chorus

Oh, that's how you study the **(G)** stars\
That's how you study the **(Bm)** stars\
And that's how you know them by **(Asus4)** heart\
Life is a lucid **(Em)** dream

### Verse 2

**(G)** Such is the path of a **(Bm)** dreamer\
**(Asus4)** I find my way by **(Em)** moonlight\
**(G)** My imagination **(Bm)** gives me wings\
And **(Asus4)** I can go **(Em)** anywhere

### Pre-Chorus

And **(G)** when I wander away\
To some other **(Bm)** place\
I'm suddenly there, way up in the **(Asus4)** air\
Where passenger trains catch fire and **(Em)** fill the sky with flames\
And **(G)** that black rabbit of death\
Wakes up in a **(Bm)** breath of beautiful dreams\
My heartache, it **(Asus4)** seems so terribly vain\
Where fire and **(Em)** diamonds fall like rain

### Chorus

Do you **(G)** believe in endless miracles\
Do you **(Bm)** believe in the impossible\
Do you **(Asus4)** believe\
Sleep is a time **(Em)** machine\
Do you **(G)** believe in curiosity\
Do you **(Bm)** believe in what you cannot see\
Do you **(Asus4)** believe\
Life is a lucid **(Em)** dream

### Post-Chorus

Oh, that's how you study the **(G)** stars\
That's how you study the **(Bm)** stars\
And that's how you know them by **(Asus4)** heart\
Life is a lucid **(Em)** dream

Oh, that's how you study the **(G)** stars\
That's how you study the **(Bm)** stars\
And that's how you know them by **(Asus4)** heart\
Life is a lucid **(Em)** dream

### Outro

**(G)** I am a light **(Bm)** sleeper\
But **(Asus4)** I am a heavy **(Em)** dreamer\
