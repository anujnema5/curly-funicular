### IntroÂ 

**(Em)** 

### Verse 1

Comes the **(A)** morning when I can **(D)** feel\
That there's **(G)** nothing left to be **(Em)** concealed\
Moving **(A)** on a scene **(D)** surreal\
Know my **(G)** heart will never\
Will never be **(A)** far from here

### Chorus

**(Bm)** Sure **(D)** as I am **(A)** breathing, sure as I'm **(Bm)** sad\
I'll **(D)** keep this **(A)** wisdom in my flesh\
**(Bm)** I **(D)** leave here **(A)** believing more than I **(Bm)** had\
And **(D)** there's a **(A)** reason I'll be\
A reason I'll be **(G)** back **(Em)** 

### Verse 2

As I **(A)** walk the hemis **(D)** phere\
I've got my **(G)** wish to up and disap **(Em)** pear\
I've been **(A)** wounded, I've been **(D)** healed\
Now for **(G)** landing, I've been landing, I've been **(Bm)** cleared

### Chorus

**(Bm)** Sure **(D)** as I am **(A)** breathing, sure as I'm **(Bm)** sad\
I'll **(D)** keep this **(A)** wisdom in my flesh\
**(Bm)** I **(D)** leave here be **(A)** lieving more than I **(Bm)** had\
This **(D)** love has **(A)** got no ceiling.
