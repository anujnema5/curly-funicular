### [Verse 1]

**(F)** Let me tell you a **(C)** story about a boy and a **(Dm)** girl\
**(Dm)** It's **(F)** kinda short, **(C)** kinda boring, but the end is a **(Dm)** whirl\
**(Dm)** They were just **(Am)** sixteen when the people were **(G)** mean\
**(C)** So they didn't love themselves, and now they're gone\
**(C)** Headstones on a **(F)** lawn

### [Verse 2]

**(F)** And when I was **(C)** younger, I knew a boy and a **(Fmaj7)** boy\
**(Fmaj7)** Best friends with each **(C)** other, but always wished they were **(Fmaj7)** more\
**(Fmaj7)** Cause they **(Am7)** loved one another, **(G)** but never discovered\
**(Fmaj7)** Cause they were too afraid of what **(C)** they'd say\
**(C)** Moved to different **(Fmaj7)** states

### [Chorus]

**(Fmaj7)** Oh, and **(G)** I'm afraid that's just the way the **(Fmaj7)** world works\
**(Fmaj7)** It ain't **(C)** funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't **(G)** sweet\
**(G)** Oh, and **(Em)** I'm afraid that's just the way the **(F)** world works\
**(F)** But I **(C)** think that it could work for you and **(G)** me\
**(G)** Just wait and **(C)** see\
**(Fmaj7)** It's not the end of the **(C)** story

### [Verse 3]

**(F)** Now it's on to the **(C)** sequel about me and my **(F)** friend\
**(F)** Both our parents were **(C)** evil, so we both made a **(F)** bet\
**(F)** If we worked and we **(Am)** saved, we could **(G)** both run away\
**(F)** And we'd have a better life, and I was **(C)** right\
**(C)** I wonder if she's **(F)** alright

### [Chorus]

**(F)** Oh, and **(G)** I'm afraid that's just the way the **(F)** world works\
**(F)** It ain't **(C)** funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't **(G)** sweet\
**(G)** Oh, and **(Em)** I'm afraid that's just the way the **(F)** world works\
**(F)** But I **(C)** think that it could work for you and **(G)** me\
**(G)** Just wait and **(C)** see\
**(F)** It's not the end of the **(C)** story, **(F)** hmm, **(C)** hmm

### [Bridge]

**(C)** And the **(F)** movie's always runnin' in my **(C)** head\
**(C)** All the **(F)** people, all the lovers, all my **(C)** friends\
**(C)** And I **(F)** hope that they all get their happy **(C)** end\
**(C)** In the end **(F)**

### [Chorus]

**(F)** Oh, and **(G)** I'm afraid that's just the way the **(F)** world works\
**(F)** It ain't **(C)** funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't **(G)** sweet\
**(G)** Oh, and **(Em)** I'm afraid that's just the way the **(F)** world works\
**(F)** But I **(C)** think that it could work for you and **(G)** me\
**(G)** Just wait and **(C)** see\
**(F)** It's not the end of the **(C)** story, **(F)** hmm, **(C)** hmm
