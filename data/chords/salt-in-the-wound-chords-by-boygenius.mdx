**Intro** - **(A)** **(D)** **(A)**

### Verse 1

You put **(D)** salt in the **(A)** wound\
And a **(D)** kiss on my **(A)** cheek\
You **(Bm)** butter me **(F#m)** up\
And you **(D)** sit down to **(A)** eat\
You add **(D)** insult to **(A)** injury\
You **(D)** say you **(A)** believe in me\
But you **(Bm)** haven't **(F#m)** decided\
About **(D)** taking or **(A)** leaving me

### Chorus

But **(G)** you take and you take\
Like **(D)** silks up my **(A)** sleeve\
Tied **(G)** corner to corner, never **(D)** en **(A)** ding\
**(G)** Trick after trick, **(F#m)** I make the magic\
And **(E7)** you unrelenting **(E)** ly ask **(D)** for the **(A)** secret

### Verse 2

Neck full of **(A)** mockingbirds\
All **(D)** callin' your **(A)** name\
I **(Bm)** tried to **(F#m)** sing it all back\
Like I heard it, it **(D)** don't sound the **(A)** same\
I'm **(D)** gnashing my **(A)** teeth\
Like a **(D)** child of **(A)** Cain\
**(Bm)** If **(F#m)** this is a prison\
I'm willing to **(D)** buy my own **(A)** chains

### Chorus

But you **(G)** take and you take\
Like **(D)** silks up my **(A)** sleeve\
Tied **(G)** corner to corner, never **(D)** en **(A)** ding\
**(G)** Trick after trick, **(F#m)** I make the magic\
And **(E7)** you unrelentingly **(D)** ask for the **(A)** secret

### Outro

They **(A)** say the hearts and **(G)** minds are on your **(D)** side\
They **(A)** say the finish **(G)** line is in your **(D)** sights\
What **(A)** they don't say is **(G)** what's on the other **(D)** side\
They **(A)** say the hearts and **(G)** minds are on your **(D)** side
