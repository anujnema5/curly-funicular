### **Verse 1**

**(C#m)** There's still so far **(A)** to go and I can't feel my **(E)** toes\
**(E)** When the rain soaks through the **(B)** heels and slips to the **(C#m)** sole\
**(C#m)** Yeah, the blades are two feet tall, **(A)** I wade in green\
**(E)** I'm movin' forward, to where? God only **(B)** knows\
**(C#m)** Feel the wind's harsh **(A)** refrain like the clouds gripped my **(E)** face\
**(E)** Saying, "It's alright to **(B)** run from all this **(C#m)** pain"\
**(C#m)** Oh, and when it's time to go **(A)** with one last breath that's **(E)** in my lungs\
**(E)** I'll scream, **(B)** "It's all for love," I'll scream, "It's all for **(A)** love"

### **Chorus**

**(A)** Come and kiss me, **(E)** salt **(A)** water\
**(A)** Oh, finally, **(E)** I feel, at three or four **(B)** degrees\
**(B)** I'm free in **(E)** salt **(A)** water\
**(A)** Embrace the **(E)** deep and leave every **(B)** thing\
**(B)** It was just a **(C#m)** dream

### **Verse 2**

**(C#m)** I can see it up ahead **(A)** where the sky meets the **(E)** ground\
**(E)** And after that, there's only **(B)** moving **(C#m)** grey\
**(C#m)** I am filled up with **(A)** regret\
**(A)** With things I did or **(E)** never said, just leave that well **(B)** alone

### **Chorus**

**(B)** And Come and kiss me, **(E)** salt **(A)** water\
**(A)** Oh, finally, **(E)** I feel, at three or four **(B)** degrees\
**(B)** I'm free in **(E)** salt **(A)** water\
**(A)** Embrace the **(E)** deep and leave every **(B)** thing\
**(B)** It was just a **(F#m)** dream

### **Post Chorus**

**(Ah-ah)**
**(B)** It was just a **(C#m)** dream\
**(A)** It was just a **(F#m)** dream\
Ah-ah **(B)** It was just a **(E)** dream\
**(A)** Was it just a **(C#m)** dream?

### **Bridge**

**(C#m)** Now, I'm standing **(A)** on the edge, gazing into **(E)** hell\
**(E)** Or is it somethin' else? **(B)** I just can't **(C#m)** tell\
**(C#m)** When there's nothin' **(A)** left, I close my eyes and **(E)** take one step\
**(E)** And say, "Well, here it **(B)** goes," I say, "Well, here it **(A)** goes"

### **Chorus**

**(A)** Come and kiss me, **(E)** salt **(A)** water\
**(A)** Oh, finally, **(E)** I feel, at three or four **(B)** degrees\
**(B)** I'm free in **(E)** salt **(A)** water\
**(A)** Embrace the **(E)** deep and leave every **(B)** thing\
**(B)** It was just a **(E)** dream

**(A)** **(E)** **(B)**
