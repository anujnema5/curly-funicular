### Verse 1

**(B)** For sale **(F#)** by **(E)** owner sign on Highway **(G#m)** 59\
**(F#)** A signal of the **(G#m)** times, a **(F#)** turning **(E)** of the **(G#m)** page **(F#)**\
**(B)** There used to be **(F#)** nothing **(E)** here but that nothing dis-**(F#)** appeared\
**(F#)** The pond, the barn, the farm, **(G#m)** the fields **(F#)** have long\
**(E)** since been **(G#m)** replaced **(F#m)**\
**(E)** Asphalt parking where that ten pew, **(F#)** Pentecostal stood\
**(E)** Fast food, four lanes and a **(F#)** subdivided neighborhood

### Chorus

**(B)** The walls of the **(F#)** world are closin' in\
**(G#m)** The spreadin' city **(D#m)** spreads us thin\
**(E)** We can't seem **(B)** to make our **(E)** ends meet the **(G#m)** bla-**(F#)**ck\
**(B)** Nеver would've thought **(F#)** it wouldn't **(G#m)** last\
**(G#m)** A way of **(D#m)** life that timе moved **(E)** past\
**(E)** What I **(B)** wouldn't give to **(E)** have the back **(G#m)** forty **(F#)** back

### Verse 2

**(B)** Maybe I'm a **(F#)** sucker **(E)** for knowing who **(G#m)** lives next **(F#)** door\
**(F#)** A view from my **(G#m)** back **(F#)** porch, a pinch
**(E)** of peace and **(G#m)** **(F#)** quiet\
**(B)** I can't get back the **(F#)** used to **(E)** bes, so I hang on to the **(G#m)** memories\
**(F#)** Of when I could **(G#m)** still **(F#)** look up and see the\
**(E)** stars not **(F#)** street **(F#)** lights shining

### Chorus

**(B)** The walls of the **(F#)** world are closin' in\
**(G#m)** The spreadin' city **(D#m)** spreads us thin\
**(E)** We can't seem **(B)** to make our **(E)** ends meet the **(G#m)** bla-**(F#)**ck\
**(B)** Nеver would've thought **(F#)** it wouldn't **(G#m)** last\
**(G#m)** A way of **(D#m)** life that timе moved **(E)** past\
**(E)** What I **(B)** wouldn't give to **(E)** have the back **(G#m)** forty **(F#)** back

### Outro

**(B)** Now I get that **(F#)** progress has its **(G#m)** place\
**(G#m)** And no **(D#m)** regard for what it **(E)** takes\
**(E)** Wish it **(B)** would slow its pace **(E)** and cut us all some **(G#m)** sla-**(F#)**ck\
**(B)** Cause it's all **(F#)** changing way too **(G#m)** fast\
**(G#m)** A way of **(Bm)** life that time moved **(E)** past\
**(E)** What I wouldn't **(B)** give to **(E)** have the back **(G#m)** forty back
