### **Verse 1**

**(Gm)** **(Bb)** **(F)** **(Eb)** x4\
**(Gm)** **(Bb)** **(Eb)** x 4

**(Eb)** Why can't we rearrange the tectonic plates?\
**(Eb)**There's another **(G)** painted **(F)** woman at the **(Eb)** foot of the stage\
**(Eb)** Blue **(Gm)** eyes, black thighs, you **(F)** don't give a **(Eb)** damn\
**(Gm)** As every cheek in this room prepares **(F)** to give you a **(Eb)** hand

### **Verse 2**

**(Eb)** Cheap beer and **(Bb)** moonlight were never **(Bb)** enough\
**(Bb)** And every **(Gm)** time I cried **(G)** wolf, **(F)** you had to call my **(Eb)** bluff\
**(Eb)** You'd **(Gm)** start to call me **(F)** more fashionable **(Eb)** names\
**(Eb)** I **(Gm)** chipped my teeth **(F)** on the wedding **(Eb)** day

### **Verse 3**

**(Gm)** Bang, bang, **(Bb)** bang goes the **(F)** front **(Eb)** door\
**(G)** And bang, **(Bb)** bang, bang **(F)** goes my heart to **(Eb)** the floor\
**(Eb)** You'd be **(Gm)** a liar if **(Bb)** you settled for **(F)** more **(Eb)**\
**(Gm)** Oh, these are the **(Bb)** plights of the **(F)** ever-**(Eb)** unsure

#### [Instrumental Break]

**(G)** **(Bb)** **(Eb)** **(G)**\
**(G)** **(Bb)** **(Eb)** **(Gm)** **(G)** **(F)**\
**(Eb)** **(Gm)** **(Bb)** **(F)** x 5

### **Verse 4**

**(Eb)** If we do this your way, it'll never be through\
**(Gm)** We've got a **(G)** lot to **(F)** say and even less to do\
**(Eb)** Bloodlust **(Gm)** is the ticket **(F)** and contrition is **(Eb)** fraud\
**(Gm)** You'll have a hell of a **(Bb)** time crawling **(F)** back to the **(Eb)** start

### **Verse 5**

**(Eb)** Build me a **(F)** cradle and make it swing **(Eb)** deep\
**(Gm)** And you can tell all the **(G)** neighbors that I just **(F)** went to **(Eb)** sleep\
**(Gm)** You'd be a liar **(Bb)** if you settled **(F)** for less, **(Eb)** oh\
**(Gm)** You'd be a **(Bb)** liar if you settled **(F)** for less, **(Eb)** oh\
**(Gm)** You'd be a **(Bb)** liar if you settled **(F)** for less, **(Eb)** oh

### **Outro**

**(Eb)** So just cut off my hands and watch me try to undress
