### Verse 1

**(B)** Loving him is like **(A)** driving a new Maserati down a **(C#m)** dead-end **(B)** street\
**(A)** Faster than the wind, **(C#m)** passionate as sin, ending **(B)** so suddenly\

**(C#m)** (Red, red)\
**(B)** (Red, red)

### Verse 2

**(B)** Touching him was like **(A)** realizing all you ever wanted **(C#m)** was right there in **(B)** front of you\
**(B)** Memorizing him was as **(A)** easy as knowing all the **(C#m)** words to your old favorite **(B)** song\
**(B)** Fighting with him was like **(A)** trying to solve a crossword and **(C#m)** realizing there's no right **(B)** answer\
**(B)** Regretting him was like **(A)** wishing you never found out **(C#m)** that love could be that **(B)** strong

### Chorus

**(E)** Missing him was **(B)** dark gray, all alone\

**(B)** Loving him was **(A)** red\
**(C#m)** (Red, red)\
**(B)** (Red, red)

### Bridge

**(B)** Remembering him comes in **(A)** flashbacks and **(B)** echoes\
**(C#m)** Tell myself it's time now, gotta **(B)** let go\
**(B)** But moving on from him is **(A)** impossible\
**(E)** When I still see it all in my **(B)** head\
**(B)** In burning **(A)** red **(C#m)**\
**(B)** Burning, it was **(A)** red **(C#m)**

### Chorus

**(C#m)** And that's why (Red, red) he's **(B)** spinning 'round in my head\
**(A)** Comes back to me (Red, red), **(C#m)** burning red\
