**(Dm)** **(Am)** **(Bm)** **(C)**

### Verse 1

**(Dm)** Yeah, she's on a solo mission\
And she won’t **(Am)** look back 'til it's her decision\
She can have the **(Bm)** last laugh, I’ll be sure to listen\
And now I'm **(C)** not a threat, I'm just another ex\
Put me in **(Dm)** the backseat, tunnel vision\
If I'm not **(Am)** with her, then I'm not living\
Always moving **(Bm)** too fast, I don't wanna miss it\
It's all on **(C)** me, yeah, she put it on me, yeah

### Pre-Chorus

**(Dm)** Corner of my bed like I don't know you\
Pull a **(Am)** cigarette, I can tell what you’re gonna do\
I’ma **(Bm)** make a bet, if I stay then I'm gonna **(C)** lose, yeah, yeah

### Chorus

But call me whеn **(Bm)** you're on your own\
Call me when **(C)** you'rе all alone, yeah\
I hope **(Dm)** you don't regret **(Am)** you and me\
Tell me when **(Bm)** your cover’s blown\
Tell me when **(C)** you're coming home, yeah, oh

### Interlude

**(Dm)** **(Am)** **(Bm)** **(C)** \

### Verse 2

**(Dm)** Yeah, she's on a solo mission\
She cut me **(Am)** out fast, look at her precision\
And when she **(Bm)** moves past me, she's off limits\
I never held **(C)** her back, can't get her off track\
Living in the **(Dm)** fast lane of indecision\
If I cross **(F)** her path, but there's no collision\
I would even **(Bm)** take half if it's all she's giving\
I know it's not **(C)** a test, but it's hard to accept it's over

### Pre-Chorus

**(Dm)** Corner of my bed like I don't know you\
Pull a **(Am)** cigarette, I can tell what you’re gonna do\
I’ma **(Bm)** make a bet, if I stay then I'm gonna **(C)** lose, yeah, yeah

### Chorus

I’ll try my **(Dm)** best to forget me **(Am)** and you\
But call me whеn **(Bm)** you're on your own\
Call me when **(C)** you'rе all alone, yeah\
I hope **(Dm)** you don't regret **(Am)** you and me\
Tell me when **(Bm)** your cover’s blown\
Tell me when **(C)** you're coming home, yeah, oh
