**(Am)** I tried to run away **(Dm7)**\
**(Cmaj7)** There's no escape, you've taken tenure in my heart\
**(A)** I can't change how I **(Dm7)** feel\
**(Cmaj7)** Tried movin' on but I'm right here where we left off\
**(Am7)** Naked walls at my place, **(Dm7)** where you met me\
**(C)** Now they're dressed up with my mama's poetry\
**(A)** You were oceans away but you **(F)** fell deep\
**(Cmaj7)** Didn't you?\

**(A)** Driftin', I'm casta **(Dm7)**-way\

**(A)** Come show me how you **(Dm7)** feel\
**(Cmaj7)** We're runnin' out of time, **(C)** and I don't wanna see this **(E)** fall\
**(A)** All these walls that you've built, **(Dm7)** they don't scare me\
**(Cmaj7)** I can stop these withdrawals, if you let me\
**(E7)** I know you **(A)** tried but you couldn't **(F)** forget me\
**(Cmaj7)** Didn't you?\
**(C)** I know we're both not sure what **(A)** lies ahead of us
