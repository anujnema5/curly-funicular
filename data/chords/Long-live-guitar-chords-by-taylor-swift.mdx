### Verse 1

Strumming **(G)** **(C)** **(Em)** **(D)**

**(G)** I said, "Remember this moment"\
**(G)** In the back of my **(C)** mind\
**(C)** The time we stood with our **(Em)** shaking hands\
**(D)** The crowds in stands went **(C)** wild\
**(C)** We were the kings and the **(G)** queens\
**(G)** And they read off our **(C)** names\
**(C)** The night you danced like **(Em)** you knew our lives would\
**(D)** Never be the **(C)** same\
**(C)** You held your head like a **(Em)** hero on a history book **(C)** page\
**(C)** It was the end of a **(Em)** decade\
**(D)** But the start of an **(C)** age

### Chorus

**(C)** Long live **(G)** the walls we crashed **(C)** through\
**(Em7)** How the kingdom lights shined just for me and **(D)** you\
**(D)** I was screaming, **(G)** "Long live all the magic we **(C)** made"\
**(C)** And bring on all the **(Em)** pretenders\
**(C)** One day, we will be **(G)** remembered

### Verse 2

**(G)** I said, "Remember this feeling"\
**(G)** I pass the pictures **(C)** around\
**(C)** Of all the years that we **(Em)** stood there on the **(D)** sidelines\
**(D)** Wishing for right **(C)** now\
**(C)** We are the kings and the **(G)** queens\
**(G)** You traded your baseball cap for a **(C)** crown\
**(C)** When they gave us our **(Em)** trophies\
**(Em)** And we **(D)** held them up for our **(C)** town\
**(C)** And the cynics were **(Em)** outraged\
**(Em)** Screaming, "This is **(C)** absurd"\
**(C)** Cause for a moment, **(Em)** a band of thieves in **(D)** ripped up jeans got to **(C)** rule the world

### Chorus

**(C)** Long live **(G)** the walls we crashed **(C)** through\
**(C)** How the **(Em)** kingdom lights shined just for **(D)** me and you\
**(D)** I was screaming, "Long **(G)** live all the magic we **(C)** made"\
**(Em)** And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not **(D)** afraid\
**(D)** Long **(G)** live all the mountains we **(C)** moved\
**(C)** I had the time of my **(Em)** life fighting dragons with **(D)** you\
**(D)** I was screaming, **(G)** "Long live that look on your **(C)** face"\
**(C)** And bring on all the **(Em)** pretenders\
**(C)** One day, we will be **(G)** remembered

### Bridge

**(C)** Hold on to **(Em)** spinning around\
**(C)** Confetti **(Em)** falls to the ground\
**(C)** May these memories break our fall\
**(G)** Will you take a moment? Promise me **(C)** this\
**(C)** That you'll stand by me **(Em)** forever\
**(Em)** But if, God forbid, **(D)** fate should step **(C)** in\
**(C)** And force us into a **(G)** goodbye\
**(G)** If you have children **(C)** some day\
**(C)** When they point to the **(Em)** pictures\
**(D)** Please, tell 'em my **(C)** name\
**(C)** Tell 'em how the crowds **(D)** went wild\
**(C)** Tell 'em how I **(D)** hope they shine\
**(G)** Long live the walls we **(C)** crashed through\
**(C)** I had the time of my **(Em)** life with **(D)** you

### Chorus

**(C)** Long live **(G)** the walls we crashed **(C)** through\
**(C)** How the **(Em)** kingdom lights shined just for **(D)** me and you\
**(D)** I was screaming, "Long **(G)** live all the magic we **(C)** made"\
**(Em)** And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not **(D)** afraid\
**(D)** Long **(G)** live all the mountains we **(C)** moved\
**(C)** I had the time of my **(Em)** life fighting dragons with **(D)** you\
**(D)** I was screaming, **(G)** "Long live that look on your **(C)** face"\
**(C)** And bring on all the **(Em)** pretenders\
**(C)** One day, we will be **(E)** remembered
