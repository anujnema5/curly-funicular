### \[Intro\]

**(A)** **(Amaj7)** **(A7)** **(Dsus2)** **(F)** **(A)** **(Dm)** **(E7)**

### \[Verse 1\]

If a **(A)** picture paints a **(Amaj7)** thousand words\
Then **(A7)** why can't I paint **(Dsus2)** you\
The **(F)** words will never **(A)** show\
The **(Dm)** you I've come to **(E7)** know

### \[Verse 2\]

If a **(A)** face could launch a **(Amaj7)** thousand ships\
Then **(A7)** where am I to **(Dsus2)** go\
There's **(F)** no one home but **(A)** you\
You're **(Dm)** all that's left me **(E7)** to

### \[Chorus\]

And **(Em)** when my **(Gaug)** love\
For **(Em7)** life is running **(Em6)** dry\
You **(Dm)** come and **(E7)** pour your **(Am)** self on **(E7)** me

### \[Verse 3\]

If a **(A)** man could be two **(Amaj7)** places\
At one **(A7)** time I'd be with **(Dsus2)** you\
To **(F)** morrow and to **(A)** day\
Be **(Dm)** side you all the **(E7)** way

### \[Verse 4\]

If the **(A)** world should stop re **(Amaj7)** volving\
Spinning **(A7)** slowly down to **(C)** die\
I'd **(F)** spend the end with **(A)** you\
And **(Dm)** when the world was **(E7)** through

### \[Chorus\]

Then **(Em)** one by **(Gaug)** one\
The **(Em7)** stars would all go **(Em6)** out\
Then **(Dm)** you and **(E7)** I\
Would **(Am)** simply **(E7)** fly a **(A)** way **(Dsus2)** **(Dm)** **(A)**
