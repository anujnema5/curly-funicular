### Intro

**(Am)** **(Fmaj7)** **(C)** **(G)**\

### Chorus

You cut **(Am)** out a piece of me and now I **(Fmaj7)** bleed internally\
Left here **(C)** without you \[No, no, no\], **(G)** without you **(Ooh)**\
And it **(Am)** hurts for me to think about what **(Fmaj7)** life could possibly be like\
**(C)** Without you **(No, no, no)**, **(G)** without you \[No, no\]

### Verse

I can't **(Am)** believe that you would up and **(Fmaj7)** leave me\
Fuck all of your **(C)** reasons\
I lost my shit, you **(G)** know I didn't mean it\
Now I **(Am)** see it, you run and **(Fmaj7)** repeat it\
And I can't take it **(C)** back, so in the past is where we'll **(G)** leave it, huh

### Pre-Chorus

So there you **(Am)** go, oh\
Can't make a wife out of a **(Fmaj7)** hoe, oh\
I'll never find the **(C)** words to say I'm sorry\
But I'm **(E)** scared to be alone

### Chorus

You cut **(Am)** out a piece of me and now I **(Fmaj7)** bleed internally\
Left here **(C)** without you \[No, no, no\], **(G)** without you **(Ooh)**\
And it **(Am)** hurts for me to think about what **(Fmaj7)** life could possibly be like\
**(C)** Without you **(No, no, no)**, **(G)** without you \[No, no\]

### Post-Chorus

Oh - **(Am)** oh, wah-oh… oh-oh, wah-oh\
Oh - **(Fmaj7)** oh, wah-oh… oh-oh, wah-oh\
**(C)** Without you, **(G)** without you\
Oh - **(Am)** oh, wah-oh… oh-oh, wah-oh\
Oh - **(Fmaj7)** oh, wah-oh… oh-oh, wah-oh\
**(C)** Without you, **(G)** without you

### Bridge

It's **(Am)** gon' be hard here on my own\
And **(Fmaj7)** even harder to let you go\
I **(C)** really wish that we, could have got this **(G)** right

### Pre-Chorus

So there you **(Am)** go, oh\
Can't make a wife out of a **(Fmaj7)** hoe, oh\
I'll never find the **(C)** words to say I'm sorry\
But I'm **(E)** scared to be alone

### Chorus

You cut **(Am)** out a piece of me and now I **(Fmaj7)** bleed internally\
Left here **(C)** without you \[No, no, no\], **(G)** without you **(Ooh)**\
And it **(Am)** hurts for me to think about what **(Fmaj7)** life could possibly be like\
**(C)** Without you **(No, no, no)**, **(G)** without you \[No, no\]

### Post-Chorus

Oh - **(Am)** oh, wah-oh… oh-oh, wah-oh\
Oh - **(Fmaj7)** oh, wah-oh… oh-oh, wah-oh\
**(C)** Without you, **(G)** without you \[No. no. no\]
