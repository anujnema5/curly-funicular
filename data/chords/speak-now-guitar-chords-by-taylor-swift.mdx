### Intro

**(G)** **(G)**

### Verse

**(G)** I am not the kind of **(D)** girl\
Who should be **(Am)** rudely barging in\
On a **(C)** white veil occasion\
But **(G)** you are not the kind of **(D)** boy\
Who should be **(Am)** marrying the wrong **(C)** girl **(-stop)**\
**(G)** I sneak in and see your **(D)** friends\
And her **(Am)** snotty little family\
All **(C)** dressed in pastel\
And **(G)** she is yelling at a **(D)** bridesmaid\
Somewhere **(Am)** back inside a room\
Wearing a **(C)** gown shaped like a pastry\
**(Am)** Thi--is **(C)** is **(G)** surely not\
What you thought it would **(D)** be\
**(Am)** **(C)** I---I lose myself in a **(D)** daydream\
Where I stand and say

### Chorus

**(G)** Don't say "Yes" **(D)** run away now\
**(Am)** I'll meet you when you're out\
Of the **(C)** church at the back **(G)** door\
Don't wait or **(D)** say a single vow\
**(Am)** You need to hear me out\
And they **(C)** **(-stop)** said "Speak Now"

### Instrumental

**(G)** **(D)** **(Am)** **(C)**

### Verse

**(G)** Fond gestures are **(D)** exchanged\
And the **(Am)** organ starts to play a song\
That **(C)** sounds like a death march\
And **(G)** I am hiding in the **(D)** curtains\
It seems that **(Am)** I was uninvited\
By your **(C)** lovely bride-to-be\
**(Am)** She **(C)** floats down the aisle\
Like a **(G)** pageant **(D)** queen\
But **(Am)** I--I **(C)** kno--ow\
You **(G)** wish it was me\
D - stop\
You wish it was me- Don't you?

### Chorus

**(G)** Don't say "Yes" **(D)** run away now\
**(Am)** I'll meet you when you're out\
Of the **(C)** church at the back **(G)** door\
Don't wait or **(D)** say a single vow\
**(Am)** You need to hear me out\
And they **(C)** said "Speak **(G)** Now"\
Don't say "Yes" **(D)** run away now\
**(Am)** I'll meet you when you're out\
Of the **(C)** church at the back **(G)** door\
Don't wait or **(D)** say a single vow\
**(Am)** Your time is running out\
And they **(C)** said "Speak **(G)** Now"\
**(D)** Ohooho **(Am)** **(C)** laaaahhoh **(G)**\
**(D)** Oooh**(Say you see me **(Am)** n**(C)** ow)** ooohooh

### Verse

Em\* **(One strum)**  C\* **(One strum)**\
I hear the preacher say speak now\
**(G)** \* **(D)** \* **(D)**\
Or forever **(G)** hold your **(D)** pe---ace\
**(Am)** There's a silence, there's my last chance\
**(C)** I stand up with shaky hands\
All **(G)** eyes on **(D)** me\
**(Am)** Horrified looks from **(C)** everyone in the room\
But **(D)** I'm only lookin' at **(D)** **(-)** you **(once)**\
**(G)** I am not the kind of **(D)** girl\
Who should be **(Am)** rudely barging in\
On a **(C)** white veil occasion\
But **(G)** you are not the kind of **(D)** boy\
Who should be **(Am)** marrying the wrong **(C)** girl

### Chorus

Oops! **(G)** Don't say "Yes" **(D)** run away now\
**(Am)** I'll meet you when you're out\
Of the **(C)** church at the back **(G)** door\
Don't wait or **(D)** say a single vow\
**(Am)** You need to hear me out\
They **(C)** said "Speak **(G)** Now"\
And you say "Lets **(D)** run away now"\
I'll **(Am)** meet you when I'm out\
Of my **(C)** tux at the back door **(G)**\
Baby I **(D)** didn't say my vows\
So **(Am)** glad you were around\
When they **(C)** said "Speak **(G)** now"
